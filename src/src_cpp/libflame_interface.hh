/*! @brief The minimum-norm solution to a real linear least squares problem
    *

    * @details
    * \b Purpose:
    * \verbatim
        Computation of the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least squares problem:
        minimize 2-norm(| B - A*X |)
        using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an m-by-n matrix which may be
        rank-deficient.

        Several right hand side vectors B and solution vectors X can be handled in a single call;
        they are stored as the columns of the m-by-nrhs  right hand side matrix b and the n-by-nrhs
        solution matrix X.

        The problem is solved in three steps:
        (1) Reduce the coefficient matrix a to bidiagonal form with Householder transformations,
        reducing the original problem into a "bidiagonal least squares problem" (BLS)
        (2) Solve the BLS using a divide and conquer approach.
        (3) Apply back all the Householder transformations to solve the original least squares
        problem.

        The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those singular values which are
        less than rcond times the largest singular value.

        The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about floating point
        arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard digit in add/subtract, or on those
        binary machines without guard digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP,
        Cray C-90, or Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines without
        guard digits, but we know of none.

    The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns

    s is float/double array, dimension (min(m,n)) \n

    The condition number of A in the 2-norm = S(1)/S(min(m,n)).

    * @param[in] rcond
    rcond is float/double* \n
    rcond is used to determine the effective rank of a. \n

    If rcond < 0, machine precision is used instead.

    * @param[in]	LWORK	
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK must be at least 1.
          The exact minimum amount of workspace needed depends on M,
          N and NRHS. As long as LWORK is at least
              2 * N + N * NRHS

              2 * M + M * NRHS
          if M is less than N, the code will execute correctly.
          For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the array WORK and the
          minimum sizes of the arrays RWORK and IWORK, and returns
          these values as the first entries of the WORK, RWORK and

          if M is less than N, the code will execute correctly.
          SMLSIZ is returned by ILAENV and is equal to the maximum
          size of the subproblems at the bottom of the computation
          tree (usually about 25), and

        this matrix to tridiagonal form.

        This code makes very mild assumptions about floating point arithmetic. It will work on
        machines with a guard digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
        digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or Cray-2. It could

/*! @brief Tridiagonal MRRR algorithm
    *
    * @details
    * \b Purpose:
    * \verbatim
        Tridiagonal MRRR algorithm.
        Computation of selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a real symmetric
        tridiagonal matrix T. Any such unreduced matrix has a well defined set of pairwise
        different real eigenvalues, the corresponding real eigenvectors are pairwise orthogonal.

        The spectrum may be computed either completely or partially by specifying either an
        interval (vl,vu] or a range of indices il:iu for the desired eigenvalues.

        Depending on the number of desired eigenvalues, these are computed either by bisection or
        the dqds algorithm. Numerically orthogonal eigenvectors are computed by the use of various
        suitable L D L^T factorizations near clusters of close eigenvalues (referred to as RRRs,
        Relatively Robust Representations). An informal sketch of the algorithm follows.

        For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
        (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
        define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
        This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
        cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
        tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
        (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
        accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
        the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
        (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
        shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
        the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
        the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
        factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

    * @details
    * \b Purpose:
    * \verbatim
        Computation of eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for HE
        matrices. CHEEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a complex
        Hermitian matrix a. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a
        range of values or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

        CHEEVR first reduces the matrix a to tridiagonal form T with a call to CHETRD.  Then,
        whenever possible, CHEEVR calls CSTEMR to compute the eigenspectrum using Relatively
        Robust Representations. CSTEMR computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while
        orthogonal eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations (also
        known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is avoided as
        far as possible. More specifically, the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.

        For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
        (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
        define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
        This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
        cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
        tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
        (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
        accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
        the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
        (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
        shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
        the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.

/*! @brief Hermitian eigenvalue decomposition (MRRR)
    *

    * @details
    * \b Purpose:
    * \verbatim
        Hermitian eigenvalue decomposition (MRRR).
        Computation of eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for SY
        matrices

        SSYEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a real symmetric
        matrix a. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a range of
        values or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

        SSYEVR first reduces the matrix a to tridiagonal form T with a call to SSYTRD.  Then,
        whenever possible, SSYEVR calls SSTEMR to compute the eigenspectrum using Relatively
        Robust Representations. SSTEMR computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
        eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations (also known as
        Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is avoided as far as
        possible. More specifically, the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.

        For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
        (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
        define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
        This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
        cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
        tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
        (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
        accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
        the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
        (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
        shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
        the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
        the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
        factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

        The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input parameter abstol.

        Internal Parameters:
        ====================
        TOLMUL  T*, default = max(10,min(100,EPS**(-1/8)))
        TOLMUL controls the convergence criterion of the QR loop.
        If it is positive, TOLMUL*EPS is the desired relative
        precision in the computed singular values.
        If it is negative, abs(TOLMUL*EPS*sigma_max) is the
        desired absolute accuracy in the computed singular
        values (corresponds to relative accuracy
        abs(TOLMUL*EPS) in the largest singular value.
        abs(TOLMUL) should be between 1 and 1/EPS, and preferably
        between 10 (for fast convergence) and .1/EPS
        (for there to be some accuracy in the results).
        Default is to lose at either one eighth or 2 of the
        available decimal digits in each computed singular value
        (whichever is smaller).

        MAXITR  integer*, default = 6
        MAXITR controls the maximum number of passes of the
        algorithm through its inner loop. The algorithms stops
        (and so fails to converge) if the number of passes
        through the inner loop exceeds MAXITR*N**2.

        using a divide and conquer method, where S is a diagonal matrix with non-negative diagonal
        elements (the singular values of B), and U and vt are orthogonal matrices of left and
        right singular vectors, respectively. SBDSDC can be used to compute all singular values,
        and optionally, singular vectors or singular vectors in compact form.

        This code makes very mild assumptions about floating point arithmetic. It will work on
        machines with a guard digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
        digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or Cray-2. It could
        conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines without guard digits, but we know of
        none.  See SLASD3 for details.

        The code currently calls SLASDQ if singular values only are desired. However, it can be
        slightly modified to compute singular values using the divide and conquer method.

/*! @brief BDSVDX computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real  \n
     N-by-N (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix B
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
     BDSVDX computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
     N-by-N (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix B, B = U * S * VT,
     where S is a diagonal matrix with non-negative diagonal elements
     (the singular values of B), and U and VT are orthogonal matrices
     of left and right singular vectors, respectively.

     Given an upper bidiagonal B with diagonal D = [ d_1 d_2 ... d_N ]
     and superdiagonal E = [ e_1 e_2 ... e_N-1 ], SBDSVDX computes the
     singular value decompositon of B through the eigenvalues and
     eigenvectors of the N*2-by-N*2 tridiagonal matrix

           |  0  d_1                |
           | d_1  0  e_1            |

           |              .   .   . |

     If (s,u,v) is a singular triplet of B with ||u|| = ||v|| = 1, then
     (+/-s,q), ||q|| = 1, are eigenpairs of TGK, with q = P * ( u' +/-v') /
     sqrt(2) = ( v_1 u_1 v_2 u_2 ... v_n u_n) / sqrt(2), and
     P = [ e_{n+1} e_{1} e_{n+2} e_{2} ... ].

     Given a TGK matrix, one can either a) compute -s,-v and change signs
     so that the singular values (and corresponding vectors) are already in
     descending order (as in SGESVD/SGESDD) or b) compute s,v and reorder
     the values (and corresponding vectors). SBDSVDX implements a) by
     calling SSTEVX (bisection plus inverse iteration, to be replaced
     with a version of the Multiple Relative Robust Representation
     algorithm. (See P. Willems and B. Lang, A framework for the MR^3

/*! @brief General matrix singular value decomposition (divide-and-conquer)
  * @details
  * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
    Computation of singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real m-by-n matrix a, optionally
    computing the left and right singular vectors.  If singular vectors are desired, it uses a
    divide-and-conquer algorithm.

    The SVD is written

    A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)

    where SIGMA is an m-by-n matrix which is zero except for its min(m,n) diagonal elements,
    U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and V is an n-by-n orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal
    elements of SIGMA are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and are
    returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of U and V are the left and right
    singular vectors of A.

    Note that the routine returns vt = V**T, not V.

    The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about floating point
    arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard digit in add/subtract, or on those
    binary machines without guard digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray
    C-90, or Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines without

        For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
        various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
        normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

        Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
               max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
              ------------------------------
                    max_j abs(X(j,i))

        The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
        below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
        returned.

        The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
        right-hand side.

        The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
        three fields:
        err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

        err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

        err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

        ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
        For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
        various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
        componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

        Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                      abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
               max_j ----------------------
                           abs(X(j,i))

        The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
        componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
        information as described below. There currently are up to three
        pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
        componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
        ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
        the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

        The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
        right-hand side.

        The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
        three fields:
        err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

        err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

        err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                sums of Z are approximately 1.

        See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
        cautions.
 * @param[in] NPARAMS
        NPARAMS is INTEGER \n
        Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
        PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
 * @param[in,out] PARAMS
        PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
        Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
        that entry will be filled with default value used for that
        parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
        are used for higher-numbered parameters.

        PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0
            = 0.0:  No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                    computed.
            = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

        PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

        PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
            is true, 0.0 is false.
         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)

        WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
 * @param[out]	RWORK

        INFO is INTEGER
        = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
         guaranteed.
        < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
        > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
         is returned.
        = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
         componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
         ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
         about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or

          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is
          used. If RWORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then
          RWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the
          leading INFO columns of A.
 * @param[out]	INFO	
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
                       singular, so the solution and error bounds
                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

 * @return INTEGER Return value of the function.

/*! @brief  GBSVXX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for GB matrices
*
* @details
* \b Purpose
* \verbatim
     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.
   \endverbatim

 * @param[in] FACT
        FACT is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
        supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
        equilibrated before it is factored.
         = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
                 If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                 equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
                 A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
         = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
         = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                 copied to AF and factored.
 * @param[in] TRANS
        TRANS is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the form of the system of equations:
          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate Transpose = Transpose)
 * @param[in] N
        N is INTEGER \n
        The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
        matrix A.  N >= 0.
 * @param[in] KL
        KL is INTEGER \n
        The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
 * @param[in] KU
        KU is INTEGER \n
        The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
 * @param[in] NRHS
        NRHS is INTEGER \n
        The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
        of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
 * @param[in,out] AB
        AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
        On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.
        The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
        array AB as follows:
        AB(KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+kl)

        If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is not 'N', then AB must have been
        equilibrated by the scaling factors in R and/or C.  AB is not
        modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and
        EQUED = 'N' on exit.

        On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:
        EQUED = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A
        EQUED = 'C':  A := A * diag(C)
        EQUED = 'B':  A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).
 * @param[in] LDAB
        LDAB is INTEGER \n
        The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
 * @param[in,out] AFB
        AFB is REAL array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
        If FACT = 'F', then AFB is an input argument and on entry
        contains details of the LU factorization of the band matrix
        A, as computed by SGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular
        band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1,
        and the multipliers used during the factorization are stored
        in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AFB is
        the factored form of the equilibrated matrix A.

        If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
        returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
        of the original matrix A.

        If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
        returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
        of the equilibrated matrix A (see the description of A for
        the form of the equilibrated matrix).
 * @param[in] LDAFB
        LDAFB is INTEGER \n
        The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
 * @param[in,out] IPIV
        IPIV is INTEGER \n array, dimension (N)
        If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
        contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
        as computed by SGETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
        with row IPIV(i).

        If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
        contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
        of the original matrix A.

        If FACT = 'E', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
        contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
        of the equilibrated matrix A.
 * @param[in,out] EQUED
        EQUED is CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
         = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
         = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
                 diag(R).
         = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
                 by diag(C).
         = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                 replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
        EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
        output argument.
 * @param[in,out] R
        R is REAL array, dimension (N)
        The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
        multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
        is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
        otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
        EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
        If R is output, each element of R is a power of the radix.
        If R is input, each element of R should be a power of the radix
        to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
        powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
        result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
        lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
        input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
        reliable.
 * @param[in,out] C
        C is REAL array, dimension (N)
        The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
        multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
        is not accessed.  C is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
        otherwise, C is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
        EQUED = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must be positive.
        If C is output, each element of C is a power of the radix.
        If C is input, each element of C should be a power of the radix
        to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
        powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
        result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
        lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
        input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
        reliable.
 * @param[in,out] B
        B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
        On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
        On exit,
        if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
        if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B', B is overwritten by
          diag(R)*B;
        if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', B is
          overwritten by diag(C)*B.
 * @param[in] LDB
        LDB is INTEGER \n
        The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
 * @param[out] X
        X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
        If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
        system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit
        if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
        inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or
        inv(diag(R))*X if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B'.
 * @param[in] LDX
        LDX is INTEGER \n
        The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 * @param[out] RCOND
        RCOND is REAL
        Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
        reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
        equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
        precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
        to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
        if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
        conditioned.
 * @param[out] RPVGRW
        RPVGRW is REAL
        Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
        pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
        norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
        the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
        This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
        and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
        0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
        for the leading INFO columns of A.  In SGESVX, this quantity is
        returned in WORK(1).
 * @param[out] BERR
        BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
        Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
        componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
        (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
        makes X(j) an exact solution).
 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
        N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER \n
        Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
        and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
        ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
        ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
        For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
        various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
        normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

        Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
               max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
              ------------------------------
                    max_j abs(X(j,i))

        The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
        below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
        returned.

        The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
        right-hand side.

        The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
        three fields:
        err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

        err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

        err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

        See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
        cautions.
 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
        ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
        For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
        various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
        componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

        Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                      abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
               max_j ----------------------
                           abs(X(j,i))

        The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
        componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
        information as described below. There currently are up to three
        pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
        componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
        ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
        the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

        The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
        right-hand side.

        The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
        three fields:
        err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

        err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

        err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                sums of Z are approximately 1.

        See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
        cautions.
 * @param[in] NPARAMS
        NPARAMS is INTEGER \n
        Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
        PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
 * @param[in,out] PARAMS
        PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
        Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
        that entry will be filled with default value used for that
        parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
        are used for higher-numbered parameters.

        PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0
            = 0.0:  No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                    computed.
            = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

        PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

        PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
            is true, 0.0 is false.
         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
 * @param[out]	RWORK	
          RWORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
 * @param[out]	INFO	
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
           guaranteed.
          < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
           has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
           the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0

    scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make
    the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
    elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have an absolute value of at most
    the radix.

    R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be a power of the radix between
    SMLNUM = smallest safe number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use
    of these scaling factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition
    number of A but works well in practice.

    This routine differs from SGEEQU by restricting the scaling factors
    to a power of the radix.  Barring over- and underflow, scaling by
    these factors introduces no additional rounding errors.  However, the
    scaled entries' magnitudes are no longer approximately 1 but lie

 *  @details
 *  \b Purpose:
 *  \verbatim
    GEESX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
    eigenvalues, the real Schur form T, and, optionally, the matrix of
    Schur vectors Z.  This gives the Schur factorization A = Z*T*(Z**T).

    Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the
    real Schur form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top left;
    computes a reciprocal condition number for the average of the
    selected eigenvalues (RCONDE); and computes a reciprocal condition
    number for the right invariant subspace corresponding to the
    selected eigenvalues (RCONDV).  The leading columns of Z form an
    orthonormal basis for this invariant subspace.

    For further explanation of the reciprocal condition numbers RCONDE
    and RCONDV, see Section 4.10 of the LAPACK Users' Guide (where
    these quantities are called s and sep respectively).

    A real matrix is in real Schur form if it is upper quasi-triangular
    with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks. 2-by-2 blocks will be standardized in
    the form
             [  a  b  ]
             [  c  a  ]

    where b*c < 0. The eigenvalues of such a block are a +- sqrt(bc).

          satisfy SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering, since
          ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues

* \b Purpose:
* \verbatim
 GEEVX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
 eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.

 Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
 the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
 SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
 (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
 eigenvectors (RCONDV).

 The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
                  A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
 where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
 The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
               u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
 where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate-transpose of u(j).

 The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
 equal to 1 and largest component real.

 Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
 more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
 transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
 make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
 of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
 reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
 Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
 (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
 explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
 Users' Guide.

          LWORK >= N*N+2*N.
          For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.

/*! @brief Computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real matrix
* @details
* \b Purpose:
* \verbatim
 GEJSV computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real M-by-N
 matrix [A], where M >= N. The SVD of [A] is written as

              [A] = [U] * [SIGMA] * [V]^t,

 where [SIGMA] is an N-by-N (M-by-N) matrix which is zero except for its N
 diagonal elements, [U] is an M-by-N (or M-by-M) orthonormal matrix, and
 [V] is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements of [SIGMA] are
 the singular values of [A]. The columns of [U] and [V] are the left and
 the right singular vectors of [A], respectively. The matrices [U] and [V]
 are computed and stored in the arrays U and V, respectively. The diagonal
 of [SIGMA] is computed and stored in the array SVA.
 GEJSV can sometimes compute tiny singular values and their singular vectors much
 more accurately than other SVD routines, see below under Further Details.
 \endverbatim

 * @param[in] JOBA
         JOBA is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the level of accuracy:
       = 'C': This option works well (high relative accuracy) if A = B * D,
              with well-conditioned B and arbitrary diagonal matrix D.
              The accuracy cannot be spoiled by COLUMN scaling. The
              accuracy of the computed output depends on the condition of
              B, and the procedure aims at the best theoretical accuracy.
              The relative error max_{i=1:N}|d sigma_i| / sigma_i is
              bounded by f(M,N)*epsilon* cond(B), independent of D.
              The input matrix is preprocessed with the QRF with column
              pivoting. This initial preprocessing and preconditioning by
              a rank revealing QR factorization is common for all values of
              JOBA. Additional actions are specified as follows:
       = 'E': Computation as with 'C' with an additional estimate of the
              condition number of B. It provides a realistic error bound.
       = 'F': If A = D1 * C * D2 with ill-conditioned diagonal scalings
              D1, D2, and well-conditioned matrix C, this option gives
              higher accuracy than the 'C' option. If the structure of the
              input matrix is not known, and relative accuracy is
              desirable, then this option is advisable. The input matrix A
              is preprocessed with QR factorization with FULL (row and
              column) pivoting.
       = 'G': Computation as with 'F' with an additional estimate of the
              condition number of B, where A=D*B. If A has heavily weighted
              rows, then using this condition number gives too pessimistic
              error bound.
       = 'A': Small singular values are the noise and the matrix is treated
              as numerically rank deficient. The error in the computed
              singular values is bounded by f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
              The computed SVD A = U * S * V^t restores A up to
              f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
              This gives the procedure the licence to discard (set to zero)
              all singular values below N*epsilon*||A||.
       = 'R': Similar as in 'A'. Rank revealing property of the initial
              QR factorization is used do reveal (using triangular factor)
              a gap sigma_{r+1} < epsilon * sigma_r in which case the
              numerical RANK is declared to be r. The SVD is computed with
              absolute error bounds, but more accurately than with 'A'.
 * @param[in] JOBU
         JOBU is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether to compute the columns of U:
       = 'U': N columns of U are returned in the array U.
       = 'F': full set of M left sing. vectors is returned in the array U.
       = 'W': U may be used as workspace of length M*N. See the description
              of U.
       = 'N': U is not computed.
 * @param[in] JOBV
         JOBV is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether to compute the matrix V:
       = 'V': N columns of V are returned in the array V; Jacobi rotations
              are not explicitly accumulated.
       = 'J': N columns of V are returned in the array V, but they are
              computed as the product of Jacobi rotations. This option is
              allowed only if JOBU .NE. 'N', i.e. in computing the full SVD.
       = 'W': V may be used as workspace of length N*N. See the description
              of V.
       = 'N': V is not computed.
 * @param[in] JOBR
         JOBR is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the RANGE for the singular values. Issues the licence to
         set to zero small positive singular values if they are outside
         specified range. If A .NE. 0 is scaled so that the largest singular
         value of c*A is around SQRT(BIG), BIG=SLAMCH('O'), then JOBR issues
         the licence to kill columns of A whose norm in c*A is less than
         SQRT(SFMIN) (for JOBR = 'R'), or less than SMALL=SFMIN/EPSLN,
         where SFMIN=SLAMCH('S'), EPSLN=SLAMCH('E').
       = 'N': Do not kill small columns of c*A. This option assumes that
              BLAS and QR factorizations and triangular solvers are
              implemented to work in that range. If the condition of A
              is greater than BIG, use SGESVJ.
       = 'R': RESTRICTED range for sigma(c*A) is [SQRT(SFMIN), SQRT(BIG)]
              (roughly, as described above). This option is recommended.
                                             ===========================
         For computing the singular values in the FULL range [SFMIN,BIG]
         use SGESVJ.
 * @param[in] JOBT
         JOBT is CHARACTER*1
         If the matrix is square then the procedure may determine to use
         transposed A if A^t seems to be better with respect to convergence.
         If the matrix is not square, JOBT is ignored. This is subject to
         changes in the future.
         The decision is based on two values of entropy over the adjoint
         orbit of A^t * A. See the descriptions of WORK(6) and WORK(7).
       = 'T': transpose if entropy test indicates possibly faster
         convergence of Jacobi process if A^t is taken as input. If A is
         replaced with A^t, then the row pivoting is included automatically.
       = 'N': do not speculate.
         This option can be used to compute only the singular values, or the
         full SVD (U, SIGMA and V). For only one set of singular vectors
         (U or V), the caller should provide both U and V, as one of the
         matrices is used as workspace if the matrix A is transposed.
         The implementer can easily remove this constraint and make the
         code more complicated. See the descriptions of U and V.
 * @param[in] JOBP
         JOBP is CHARACTER*1
         Issues the licence to introduce structured perturbations to drown
         denormalized numbers. This licence should be active if the
         denormals are poorly implemented, causing slow computation,
         especially in cases of fast convergence (!). For details see [1,2].
         For the sake of simplicity, this perturbations are included only
         when the full SVD or only the singular values are requested. The
         implementer/user can easily add the perturbation for the cases of
         computing one set of singular vectors.
       = 'P': introduce perturbation
       = 'N': do not perturb
 * @param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.
 * @param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the input matrix A. M >= N >= 0.
 * @param[in,out] A
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
 * @param[in] LDA
          LDA is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
 * @param[out] SVA
          SVA is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On exit,
          - For WORK(1)/WORK(2) = ONE: The singular values of A. During the
            computation SVA contains Euclidean column norms of the
            iterated matrices in the array A.
          - For WORK(1) .NE. WORK(2): The singular values of A are
            (WORK(1)/WORK(2)) * SVA(1:N). This factored form is used if
            sigma_max(A) overflows or if small singular values have been
            saved from underflow by scaling the input matrix A.
          - If JOBR='R' then some of the singular values may be returned
            as exact zeros obtained by "set to zero" because they are
            below the numerical rank threshold or are denormalized numbers.
 * @param[out] U
          U is REAL array, dimension ( LDU, N)
          If JOBU = 'U', then U contains on exit the M-by-N matrix of
                         the left singular vectors.
          If JOBU = 'F', then U contains on exit the M-by-M matrix of
                         the left singular vectors, including an ONB
                         of the orthogonal complement of the Range(A).
          If JOBU = 'W'  .AND. (JOBV = 'V' .AND. JOBT = 'T' .AND. M = N),
                         then U is used as workspace if the procedure
                         replaces A with A^t. In that case, [V] is computed
                         in U as left singular vectors of A^t and then
                         copied back to the V array. This 'W' option is just
                         a reminder to the caller that in this case U is
                         reserved as workspace of length N*N.
          If JOBU = 'N'  U is not referenced, unless JOBT= - computes row and column scaling to reduce condition number of matrix.
 * @param[in] LDU
          LDU is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array U,  LDU >= 1.
          IF  JOBU = 'U' or 'F' or 'W',  then LDU >= M.
 * @param[out] V
          V is REAL array, dimension ( LDV, N)
          If JOBV = 'V', 'J' then V contains on exit the N-by-N matrix of
                         the right singular vectors;
          If JOBV = 'W', AND (JOBU = 'U' AND JOBT = 'T' AND M = N),
                         then V is used as workspace if the pprocedure
                         replaces A with A^t. In that case, [U] is computed
                         in V as right singular vectors of A^t and then
                         copied back to the U array. This 'W' option is just
                         a reminder to the caller that in this case V is
                         reserved as workspace of length N*N.
          If JOBV = 'N'  V is not referenced, unless JOBT='T'.
 * @param[in] LDV
          LDV is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array V,  LDV >= 1.
          If JOBV = 'V' or 'J' or 'W', then LDV >= N.
 * @param[out]	CWORK	
          CWORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(2,LWORK))
          If the call to CGEJSV is a workspace query (indicated by LWORK=-1 or
          LRWORK=-1), then on exit CWORK(1) contains the required length of 
          CWORK for the job parameters used in the call.
 * @param[in]	LWORK	
          LWORK is INTEGER
          Length of CWORK to confirm proper allocation of workspace.
          LWORK depends on the job:

          1. If only SIGMA is needed ( JOBU = 'N', JOBV = 'N' ) and
            1.1 .. no scaled condition estimate required (JOBA.NE.'E'.AND.JOBA.NE.'G'):
               LWORK >= 2*N+1. This is the minimal requirement.
               ->> For optimal performance (blocked code) the optimal value
               is LWORK >= N + (N+1)*NB. Here NB is the optimal
               block size for CGEQP3 and CGEQRF.
               In general, optimal LWORK is computed as
               LWORK >= max(N+LWORK(CGEQP3),N+LWORK(CGEQRF), LWORK(CGESVJ)).        
            1.2. .. an estimate of the scaled condition number of A is
               required (JOBA='E', or 'G'). In this case, LWORK the minimal
               requirement is LWORK >= N*N + 2*N.
               ->> For optimal performance (blocked code) the optimal value
               is LWORK >= max(N+(N+1)*NB, N*N+2*N)=N**2+2*N.
               In general, the optimal length LWORK is computed as

            of CGEQP3, CGEQRF, CGELQF, CUNMQR, CUNMLQ.
 
          If the call to CGEJSV is a workspace query (indicated by LWORK=-1 or
          LRWORK=-1), then on exit CWORK(1) contains the optimal and CWORK(2) contains the

                    column equilibrated A. (If JOBA = 'E' or 'G')
                    SCONDA is an estimate of SQRT(||(R^* * R)^(-1)||_1).
                    It is computed using SPOCON. It holds
                    N^(-1/4) * SCONDA <= ||R^(-1)||_2 <= N^(1/4) * SCONDA
                    where R is the triangular factor from the QRF of A.
                    However, if R is truncated and the numerical rank is
                    determined to be strictly smaller than N, SCONDA is
                    returned as -1, thus indicating that the smallest
                    singular values might be lost.

          useful for the analysis of the algorithm. They are provided for

          They are provided for a developer/implementer who is familiar
          with the details of the method.

                    of diag(A^* * A) / Trace(A^* * A) taken as point in the
                    probability simplex.
          RWORK(7) = the entropy of A * A^*. (See the description of RWORK(6).)
          If the call to CGEJSV is a workspace query (indicated by LWORK=-1 or

 * @param[out]	IWORK

          4. If the singular values with both the left and the right singular vectors

/*! @brief GELSY solves overdetermined or underdetermined systems for GE matrices
* @details
* \b Purpose:
 \verbatim
 GELSY computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
 squares problem:
     minimize || A * X - B ||
 using a complete orthogonal factorization of A.  A is an M-by-N
 matrix which may be rank-deficient.

 Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
 handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
 M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
 matrix X.

 The routine first computes a QR factorization with column pivoting:
     A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
                 [  0  R22 ]
 with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose estimated
 condition number is less than 1/RCOND.  The order of R11, RANK,
 is the effective rank of A.

 Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
 by orthogonal transformations from the right, arriving at the
 complete orthogonal factorization:
    A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
                [  0  0 ]
 The minimum-norm solution is then
    X = P * Z**T [ inv(T11)*Q1**T*B ]
                 [        0         ]
 where Q1 consists of the first RANK columns of Q.

 This routine is basically identical to the original xGELSX except
 three differences:
   o The call to the subroutine xGEQPF has been substituted by the
     the call to the subroutine xGEQP3. This subroutine is a Blas-3
     version of the QR factorization with column pivoting.
   o Matrix B (the right hand side) is updated with Blas-3.
   o The permutation of matrix B (the right hand side) is faster and
     more simple.

/*! @brief GERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear equations \n
    and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution
 *  @details
 *  \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
     equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
     for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code
     provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See
     comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the
     error bounds.

     The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
     before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED, R
     and C below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned
     are for the original unequilibrated system.
    \endverbatim

 * @param[in] TRANS
 
          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of the system of equations:
       = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
       = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
       = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
 

 * @param[in] EQUED
 
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
     the solution and error bounds correctly.
       = 'N':  No equilibration
       = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
               diag(R).
       = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
               by diag(C).
       = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     The original N-by-N matrix A.
 

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in] AF
 
          AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
     as computed by GETRF.
 

 * @param[in] LDAF
 
          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in] IPIV
 
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
     The pivot indices from GETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
     matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
 

 * @param[in] R
 
          R is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
     multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
     is not accessed.
     If R is accessed, each element of R should be a power of the radix
     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.
 

 * @param[in] C
 
          C is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
     multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
     is not accessed.
     If C is accessed, each element of C should be a power of the radix
     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.
 

 * @param[in] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     The right hand side matrix B.
 

 * @param[in] LDB
 
          LDB is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] X
 
          X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by GETRS.
     On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in] NPARAMS
 
          NPARAMS is INTEGER
     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
 

 * @param[in,out] PARAMS
          PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
     are used for higher-numbered parameters.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0
            = 0.0:  No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                    computed.
            = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
            is true, 0.0 is false.
         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
 * @param[out]	RWORK	
          RWORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)

         guaranteed.
       < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
       > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
         is returned.
       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
         componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
         ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information

     DSGESV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
        A * X = B,
     where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

     DSGESV first attempts to factorize the matrix in SINGLE PRECISION
     and use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure
     to produce a solution with DOUBLE PRECISION normwise backward error
     quality (see below). If the approach fails the method switches to a
     DOUBLE PRECISION factorization and solve.

     The iterative refinement is not going to be a winning strategy if
     the ratio SINGLE PRECISION performance over DOUBLE PRECISION
     performance is too small. A reasonable strategy should take the
     number of right-hand sides and the size of the matrix into account.
     This might be done with a call to ILAENV in the future. Up to now, we
     always try iterative refinement.

     The iterative refinement process is stopped if
         ITER > ITERMAX

         RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX

/*! @brief GESVDX computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) for GE matrices
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GESVDX computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
     M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular
     vectors. The SVD is written

         A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)

     where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
     min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
     V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
     are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
     are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
     U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.

     GESVDX uses an eigenvalue problem for obtaining the SVD, which
     allows for the computation of a subset of singular values and
     vectors. See BDSVDX for details.

     Note that the routine returns V**T, not V.

/*! @brief GESVJ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a M-by-N matrix A
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GESVJ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
     M-by-N matrix A, where M >= N. The SVD of A is written as
                                        [++]   [xx]   [x0]   [xx]
                  A = U * SIGMA * V^t,  [++] = [xx] * [ox] * [xx]
                                        [++]   [xx]
     where SIGMA is an N-by-N diagonal matrix, U is an M-by-N orthonormal
     matrix, and V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements
     of SIGMA are the singular values of A. The columns of U and V are the
     left and the right singular vectors of A, respectively.
     GESVJ can sometimes compute tiny singular values and their singular vectors much
     more accurately than other SVD routines, see below under Further Details.
    \endverbatim 

 * @param[in] JOBA
 
          JOBA is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the structure of A.
          = 'L': The input matrix A is lower triangular;
          = 'U': The input matrix A is upper triangular;
          = 'G': The input matrix A is general M-by-N matrix, M >= N.
 

 * @param[in] JOBU
 
          JOBU is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether to compute the left singular vectors
          (columns of U):
          = 'U': The left singular vectors corresponding to the nonzero
                 singular values are computed and returned in the leading
                 columns of A. See more details in the description of A.
                 The default numerical orthogonality threshold is set to
                 approximately TOL=CTOL*EPS, CTOL=SQRT(M), EPS=SLAMCH('E').
          = 'C': Analogous to JOBU='U', except that user can control the
                 level of numerical orthogonality of the computed left
                 singular vectors. TOL can be set to TOL = CTOL*EPS, where
                 CTOL is given on input in the array WORK.
                 No CTOL smaller than ONE is allowed. CTOL greater
                 than 1 / EPS is meaningless. The option 'C'
                 can be used if M*EPS is satisfactory orthogonality
                 of the computed left singular vectors, so CTOL=M could
                 save few sweeps of Jacobi rotations.
                 See the descriptions of A and WORK(1).

          = 'A':  the Jacobi rotations are applied to the MV-by-N
                  array V. In other words, the right singular vector
                  matrix V is not computed explicitly; instead it is
                  applied to an MV-by-N matrix initially stored in the
                  first MV rows of V.

                 is the number of computed singular values of A that are
                 above the underflow threshold SLAMCH('S'). The singular
                 vectors corresponding to underflowed or zero singular
                 values are not computed. The value of RANKA is returned
                 in the array WORK as RANKA=NINT(WORK(2)). Also see the
                 descriptions of SVA and WORK. The computed columns of U
                 are mutually numerically orthogonal up to approximately
                 TOL=SQRT(M)*EPS (default); or TOL=CTOL*EPS (JOBU = 'C'),
                 see the description of JOBU.
                 If INFO > 0,
                 the procedure GESVJ did not converge in the given number
                 of iterations (sweeps). In that case, the computed
                 columns of U may not be orthogonal up to TOL. The output
                 U (stored in A), SIGMA (given by the computed singular
                 values in SVA(1:N)) and V is still a decomposition of the
                 input matrix A in the sense that the residual
                 ||A-SCALE*U*SIGMA*V^T||_2 / ||A||_2 is small.
          If JOBU = 'N':
                 If INFO = 0:
                 Note that the left singular vectors are 'for free' in the
                 one-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm. However, if only the
                 singular values are needed, the level of numerical
                 orthogonality of U is not an issue and iterations are
                 stopped when the columns of the iterated matrix are
                 numerically orthogonal up to approximately M*EPS. Thus,
                 on exit, A contains the columns of U scaled with the
                 corresponding singular values.
                 If INFO > 0:
                 the procedure GESVJ did not converge in the given number
                 of iterations (sweeps).

          SVA is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On exit,
          If INFO = 0 :
          depending on the value SCALE = WORK(1), we have:
                 If SCALE = ONE:
                 SVA(1:N) contains the computed singular values of A.
                 During the computation SVA contains the Euclidean column
                 norms of the iterated matrices in the array A.
                 If SCALE .NE. ONE:
                 The singular values of A are SCALE*SVA(1:N), and this
                 factored representation is due to the fact that some of the
                 singular values of A might underflow or overflow.

          If INFO > 0 :
          the procedure GESVJ did not converge in the given number of
          iterations (sweeps) and SCALE*SVA(1:N) may not be accurate.
 

 * @param[in] MV
 
          MV is INTEGER
          If JOBV = 'A', then the product of Jacobi rotations in GESVJ
          is applied to the first MV rows of V. See the description of JOBV.
 

 * @param[in,out] V
 
          V is REAL array, dimension (LDV,N)
          If JOBV = 'V', then V contains on exit the N-by-N matrix of
                         the right singular vectors;
          If JOBV = 'A', then V contains the product of the computed right
                         singular vector matrix and the initial matrix in
                         the array V.
          If JOBV = 'N', then V is not referenced.
 

 * @param[in] LDV
 
          LDV is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array V, LDV >= 1.
          If JOBV = 'V', then LDV >= max(1,N).
          If JOBV = 'A', then LDV >= max(1,MV) .
 * @param[in,out]	CWORK	
          CWORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (max(1,LWORK))
          Used as workspace.
          If on entry LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed and
          no computation is done; CWORK(1) is set to the minial (and optimal)
          length of CWORK.

          Length of CWORK, LWORK >= M+N.

          On entry,
          If JOBU = 'C' :
          RWORK(1) = CTOL, where CTOL defines the threshold for convergence.
                    The process stops if all columns of A are mutually
                    orthogonal up to CTOL*EPS, EPS=SLAMCH('E').
                    It is required that CTOL >= ONE, i.e. it is not
                    allowed to force the routine to obtain orthogonality
                    below EPSILON.
          On exit,
          RWORK(1) = SCALE is the scaling factor such that SCALE*SVA(1:N)
                    are the computed singular values of A.
                    (See description of SVA().)
          RWORK(2) = NINT(RWORK(2)) is the number of the computed nonzero
                    singular values.
          RWORK(3) = NINT(RWORK(3)) is the number of the computed singular
                    values that are larger than the underflow threshold.
          RWORK(4) = NINT(RWORK(4)) is the number of sweeps of Jacobi
                    rotations needed for numerical convergence.
          RWORK(5) = max_{i.NE.j} |COS(A(:,i),A(:,j))| in the last sweep.
                    This is useful information in cases when CGESVJ did
                    not converge, as it can be used to estimate whether
                    the output is still useful and for post festum analysis.
          RWORK(6) = the largest absolute value over all sines of the
                    Jacobi rotation angles in the last sweep. It can be
                    useful for a post festum analysis.
         If on entry LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed and
         no computation is done; RWORK(1) is set to the minial (and optimal)
         length of RWORK.

          < 0:  if INFO = -i, then the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  CGESVJ did not converge in the maximal allowed number
                (NSWEEP=30) of sweeps. The output may still be useful.

          On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is

          The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is

          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X
          to the original system of equations.  Note that A and B are

          equilibrated system is inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER

          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
 

 * @param[out] FERR
 
          FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
 * @param[out]	RWORK	
          RWORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
          On exit, RWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth
          factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is
          used. If RWORK(1) is much less than 1, then the stability
          of the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A
          could be poor. This also means that the solution X, condition
          estimator RCOND, and forward error bound FERR could be
          unreliable. If factorization fails with 0<INFO<=N, then
          RWORK(1) contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor for the
          leading INFO columns of A.
 * @param[out]	INFO	
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization has
                       been completed, but the factor U is exactly
                       singular, so the solution and error bounds
                       could not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

/*! @brief GESVXX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for GE matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GESVXX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a
     real system of linear equations  A * X = B,  where A is an
     N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

     If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
     are returned. GESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
     guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
     precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
     case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
     calculated and returned.

     GESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
     factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
     Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
     GESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
     errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
     user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
     differ from what GESVXX would itself produce.

 * @param[in] FACT
 
          FACT is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
     supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
     equilibrated before it is factored.
       = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
               If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
               equilibrated with scaling factors given by R and C.
               A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
       = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
       = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
               copied to AF and factored.

       = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
       = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate Transpose = Transpose)
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
     matrix A.  N >= 0.

          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
 

 * @param[in,out] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED is
     not 'N', then A must have been equilibrated by the scaling
     factors in R and/or C.  A is not modified if FACT = 'F' or
     'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.

     On exit, if EQUED .ne. 'N', A is scaled as follows:
     EQUED = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A
     EQUED = 'C':  A := A * diag(C)
     EQUED = 'B':  A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).
 

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] AF
 
          AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
     contains the factors L and U from the factorization
     A = P*L*U as computed by GETRF.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then
     AF is the factored form of the equilibrated matrix A.

     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
     of the original matrix A.

     If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
     of the equilibrated matrix A (see the description of A for
     the form of the equilibrated matrix).

     If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
     as computed by GETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
     with row IPIV(i).

     If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
     of the original matrix A.

     If FACT = 'E', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
     contains the pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
     of the equilibrated matrix A.
 

 * @param[in,out] EQUED
 
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
               diag(R).
       = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
               by diag(C).
       = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
     output argument.
 

 * @param[in,out] R
 
          R is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
     multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
     is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
     otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
     EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
     If R is output, each element of R is a power of the radix.
     If R is input, each element of R should be a power of the radix
     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.
 

 * @param[in,out] C
 
          C is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
     multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
     is not accessed.  C is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
     otherwise, C is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
     EQUED = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must be positive.
     If C is output, each element of C is a power of the radix.
     If C is input, each element of C should be a power of the radix
     to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
     powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
     result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.
 

 * @param[in,out] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
     On exit,
     if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
     if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B', B is overwritten by
        diag(R)*B;
     if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', B is
        overwritten by diag(C)*B.
 

 * @param[in] LDB
 
          LDB is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] X
 
          X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit
     if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
     inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or
     inv(diag(R))*X if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'R' or 'B'.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] RPVGRW
 
          RPVGRW is REAL
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.  In GESVX, this quantity is
     returned in WORK(1).
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.

          NPARAMS is INTEGER
     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
 

 * @param[in,out] PARAMS
 
          PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
     are used for higher-numbered parameters.

            refinement or not.

                    computed.
            = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

/*! @brief GETRF2 computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
    GETRF2 computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
    using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
    The factorization has the form
       A = P * L * U
    where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
    diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
    triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).
    This is the recursive version of the algorithm. It divides
    the matrix into four submatrices:
           [  A11 | A12  ]  where A11 is n1 by n1 and A22 is n2 by n2
       A = [ -----|----- ]  with n1 = min(m,n)/2
           [  A21 | A22  ]       n2 = n-n1
                                          [ A11 ]
    The subroutine calls itself to factor [ --- ],
                                          [ A12 ]
                    [ A12 ]
    do the swaps on [ --- ], solve A12, update A22,
                    [ A22 ]
    then calls itself to factor A22 and do the swaps on A21.

/*! @brief GGES computes the eigenvalues, the Schur form, and, optionally, the matrix of Schur vectors for GE matrices
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GGES computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices (A,B),
     the generalized eigenvalues, the generalized real Schur form (S,T),
     optionally, the left and/or right matrices of Schur vectors (VSL and
     VSR). This gives the generalized Schur factorization

              (A,B) = ( (VSL)*S*(VSR)**T, (VSL)*T*(VSR)**T)

     Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues so that a selected cluster
     of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper
     quasi-triangular matrix S and the upper triangular matrix T.The
     leading columns of VSL and VSR then form an orthonormal basis for the
     corresponding left and right eigenspaces (deflating subspaces).

     (If only the generalized eigenvalues are needed, use the driver
     SGGEV instead, which is faster.)

     A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar w
     or a ratio alpha/beta = w, such that  A - w*B is singular.  It is
     usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as there is a
     reasonable interpretation for beta=0 or both being zero.

     A pair of matrices (S,T) is in generalized real Schur form if T is
     upper triangular with non-negative diagonal and S is block upper
     triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks.  1-by-1 blocks correspond
     to real generalized eigenvalues, while 2-by-2 blocks of S will be
     "standardized" by making the corresponding elements of T have the
     form:
             [  a  0  ]
             [  0  b  ]

     and the pair of corresponding 2-by-2 blocks in S and T will have a
     complex conjugate pair of generalized eigenvalues.

/*! @brief GGES3 computes the eigenvalues, the Schur form, and, optionally, the matrix of Schur vectors for GE matrices (blocked algorithm)
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GGES3 computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices (A,B),
     the generalized eigenvalues, the generalized real Schur form (S,T),
     optionally, the left and/or right matrices of Schur vectors (VSL and
     VSR). This gives the generalized Schur factorization

              (A,B) = ( (VSL)*S*(VSR)**T, (VSL)*T*(VSR)**T)

     Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues so that a selected cluster
     of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper
     quasi-triangular matrix S and the upper triangular matrix T.The
     leading columns of VSL and VSR then form an orthonormal basis for the
     corresponding left and right eigenspaces (deflating subspaces).

     (If only the generalized eigenvalues are needed, use the driver
     SGGEV instead, which is faster.)

     A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar w
     or a ratio alpha/beta = w, such that  A - w*B is singular.  It is
     usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as there is a
     reasonable interpretation for beta=0 or both being zero.

     A pair of matrices (S,T) is in generalized real Schur form if T is
     upper triangular with non-negative diagonal and S is block upper
     triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks.  1-by-1 blocks correspond
     to real generalized eigenvalues, while 2-by-2 blocks of S will be
     "standardized" by making the corresponding elements of T have the
     form:
             [  a  0  ]
             [  0  b  ]

     and the pair of corresponding 2-by-2 blocks in S and T will have a
     complex conjugate pair of generalized eigenvalues.

     A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar

/*! @brief GGEVX computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for GE matrices
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     SGGEVX computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices (A,B)
     the generalized eigenvalues, and optionally, the left and/or right
     generalized eigenvectors.
     Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
     the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
     LSCALE, RSCALE, ABNRM, and BBNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for
     the eigenvalues (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the
     right eigenvectors (RCONDV).
     A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar
     lambda or a ratio alpha/beta = lambda, such that A - lambda*B is
     singular. It is usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as
     there is a reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both
     being zero.
     The right eigenvector v(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
     of (A,B) satisfies
                      A * v(j) = lambda(j) * B * v(j) .
     The left eigenvector u(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
     of (A,B) satisfies
                      u(j)**H * A  = lambda(j) * u(j)**H * B.
     where u(j)**H is the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
    \endverbatim
 
 * @param[in] BALANC
 
          BALANC is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the balance option to be performed.
          = 'N':  do not diagonally scale or permute;
          = 'P':  permute only;
          = 'S':  scale only;
          = 'B':  both permute and scale.
          Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the
          matrices after permuting and/or balancing. Permuting does
          not change condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but
          balancing does.
 

 * @param[in] JOBVL
 
          JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
          = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors.
 

 * @param[in] JOBVR
 
          JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
          = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors.
 

 * @param[in] SENSE
 
          SENSE is CHARACTER*1
          Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
          = 'N': none are computed;
          = 'E': computed for eigenvalues only;
          = 'V': computed for eigenvectors only;
          = 'B': computed for eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in,out] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA, N)
          On entry, the matrix A in the pair (A,B).
          On exit, A has been overwritten. If JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V'
          or both, then A contains the first part of the real Schur
          form of the "balanced" versions of the input A and B.
 

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB, N)
          On entry, the matrix B in the pair (A,B).
          On exit, B has been overwritten. If JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V'
          or both, then B contains the second part of the real Schur
          form of the "balanced" versions of the input A and B.

 * @param[out] BETA
 
          BETA is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On exit, (ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)*i)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will
          be the generalized eigenvalues.  If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then
          the j-th eigenvalue is real; if positive, then the j-th and
          (j+1)-st eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, with
          ALPHAI(j+1) negative.

          Note: the quotients ALPHAR(j)/BETA(j) and ALPHAI(j)/BETA(j)
          may easily over- or underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.
          Thus, the user should avoid naively computing the ratio
          ALPHA/BETA. However, ALPHAR and ALPHAI will be always less
          than and usually comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and
          BETA always less than and usually comparable with norm(B).

          after another in the columns of VL, in the same order as
          their eigenvalues. If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then
          u(j) = VL(:,j), the j-th column of VL. If the j-th and
          (j+1)-th eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then
          u(j) = VL(:,j)+i*VL(:,j+1) and u(j+1) = VL(:,j)-i*VL(:,j+1).
          Each eigenvector will be scaled so the largest component have

          VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,N)
          If JOBVR = 'V', the right eigenvectors v(j) are stored one
          after another in the columns of VR, in the same order as
          their eigenvalues. If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then
          v(j) = VR(:,j), the j-th column of VR. If the j-th and
          (j+1)-th eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then
          v(j) = VR(:,j)+i*VR(:,j+1) and v(j+1) = VR(:,j)-i*VR(:,j+1).

          LDVR is INTEGER

          if JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.
 

 * @param[out] ILO
 
          ILO is INTEGER
 

 * @param[out] IHI
 
          IHI is INTEGER
          ILO and IHI are integer values such that on exit
          A(i,j) = 0 and B(i,j) = 0 if i > j and
          j = 1,...,ILO-1 or i = IHI+1,...,N.

          row interchanged with row j, and DL(j) is the scaling
          factor applied to row j, then
            LSCALE(j) = PL(j)  for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                      = DL(j)  for j = ILO,...,IHI
                      = PL(j)  for j = IHI+1,...,N.
          The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
          then 1 to ILO-1.
 

 * @param[out] RSCALE
 
          RSCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
          Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied

          The one-norm of the balanced matrix B.

          RCONDE is REAL array, dimension (N)
          If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of
          the eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the array.
          For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two consecutive
          elements of RCONDE are set to the same value. Thus RCONDE(j),
          RCONDV(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR all correspond
          to the j-th eigenpair.
          If SENSE = 'N' or 'V', RCONDE is not referenced.
 

 * @param[out] RCONDV

          If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
          numbers of the eigenvectors, stored in consecutive elements
          of the array. For a complex eigenvector two consecutive
          elements of RCONDV are set to the same value. If the
          eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute RCONDV(j),
          RCONDV(j) is set to 0; this can only occur when the true
          value would be very small anyway.

          If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= 2*N*N+8*N+16.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns

 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GGHD3 reduces a pair of real matrices (A,B) to generalized upper
     Hessenberg form using orthogonal transformations, where A is a
     general matrix and B is upper triangular.  The form of the
     generalized eigenvalue problem is
        A*x = lambda*B*x,
     and B is typically made upper triangular by computing its QR
     factorization and moving the orthogonal matrix Q to the left side
     of the equation.

     This subroutine simultaneously reduces A to a Hessenberg matrix H:
        Q**T*A*Z = H
     and transforms B to another upper triangular matrix T:
        Q**T*B*Z = T
     in order to reduce the problem to its standard form
        H*y = lambda*T*y
     where y = Z**T*x.

     The orthogonal matrices Q and Z are determined as products of Givens
     rotations.  They may either be formed explicitly, or they may be
     postmultiplied into input matrices Q1 and Z1, so that
          Q1 * A * Z1**T = (Q1*Q) * H * (Z1*Z)**T
          Q1 * B * Z1**T = (Q1*Q) * T * (Z1*Z)**T

     If Q1 is the orthogonal matrix from the QR factorization of B in the
     original equation A*x = lambda*B*x, then SGGHD3 reduces the original
     problem to generalized Hessenberg form.

     This is a blocked variant of SGGHRD, using matrix-matrix
     multiplications for parts of the computation to enhance performance.

      This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine GGSVD3.

        (R11 R12 R13) is stored in A(1:M, N-K-L+1:N), and R33 is stored

      The routine computes C, S, R, and optionally the orthogonal
      transformation matrices U, V and Q.
     
      In particular, if B is an N-by-N nonsingular matrix, then the GSVD of
      A and B implicitly gives the SVD of A*inv(B):
                           A*inv(B) = U*(D1*inv(D2))*V**T.
      If ( A**T,B**T)**T  has orthonormal columns, then the GSVD of A and B is
      also equal to the CS decomposition of A and B. Furthermore, the GSVD
      can be used to derive the solution of the eigenvalue problem:
                           A**T*A x = lambda* B**T*B x.
      In some literature, the GSVD of A and B is presented in the form
                       U**T*A*X = ( 0 D1),   V**T*B*X = ( 0 D2)
      where U and V are orthogonal and X is nonsingular, D1 and D2 are
      ``diagonal''.  The former GSVD form can be converted to the latter
      form by taking the nonsingular matrix X as
                           X = Q*( I   0   )

      The routine computes C, S, R, and optionally the orthogonal
      transformation matrices U, V and Q.
     
      In particular, if B is an N-by-N nonsingular matrix, then the GSVD of
      A and B implicitly gives the SVD of A*inv(B):
                           A*inv(B) = U*(D1*inv(D2))*V**T.
      If ( A**T,B**T)**T  has orthonormal columns, then the GSVD of A and B is
      also equal to the CS decomposition of A and B. Furthermore, the GSVD
      can be used to derive the solution of the eigenvalue problem:
                           A**T*A x = lambda* B**T*B x.
      In some literature, the GSVD of A and B is presented in the form
                       U**T*A*X = ( 0 D1),   V**T*B*X = ( 0 D2)
      where U and V are orthogonal and X is nonsingular, D1 and D2 are
      ``diagonal''.  The former GSVD form can be converted to the latter
      form by taking the nonsingular matrix X as
                           X = Q*( I   0   )
                                 ( 0 inv(R)).

/*! @brief GTSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     GTSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
     system of linear equations A * X = B or A**T * X = B,
     where A is a tridiagonal matrix of order N and X and B are N-by-NRHS
     matrices.

     Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
     provided.
     
 * \b Description:
     The following steps are performed:

     1. If FACT = 'N', the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A
        as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower
        bidiagonal matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in
        only the main diagonal and first two superdiagonals.

     2. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
        returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
        to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
        reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
        INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
        to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

     3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

          row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
          IPIV(i) will always be either i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates
          a row interchange was not required.
 

 * @param[in] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

          LDB is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

          X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.

          LDX is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
          INFO > 0.
 

 * @param[out] FERR
 
          FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)

          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has not been completed unless i = N, but the
                       factor U is exactly singular, so the solution
                       and error bounds could not be computed.
                       RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

    \verbatim
     GTTRF computes an LU factorization of a real tridiagonal matrix A
     using elimination with partial pivoting and row interchanges.
     The factorization has the form
        A = L * U

     matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in only the main

/*! @brief PBSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for OTHER matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     PBSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
     compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
        A * X = B,
     where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite band matrix and X
     and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

     Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
     provided.
     
    * \b Description:
      =================

     The following steps are performed:

     1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
        the system:
           diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
        Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
        scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
        overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

     2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
        factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
           A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower
        triangular band matrix.

     3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
        then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
        form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
        A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
        precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
        still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
        described below.

     4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

     6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
        diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
        equilibration.
    \endverbatim 

 * @param[in] FACT
 
          FACT is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be

                  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated
                  with scaling factors given by S.  AB and AFB will not
                  be modified.
          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFB and factored.
          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                  copied to AFB and factored.

          equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(KD+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KD)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(N,j+KD).
          See below for further details.

          On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
          diag(S)*A*diag(S).

          If FACT = 'F', then AFB is an input argument and on entry
          contains the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band matrix
          A, in the same storage format as A (see AB).  If EQUED = 'Y',
          then AFB is the factored form of the equilibrated matrix A.

          If FACT = 'N', then AFB is an output argument and on exit
          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.

          If FACT = 'E', then AFB is an output argument and on exit
          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated

          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
          = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
          = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
                  diag(S) * A * diag(S).
          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
          output argument.
 

 * @param[in,out] S
 
          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
          The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
          an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
          argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S
          must be positive.
 

 * @param[in,out] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
 

 * @param[out] FERR

          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)
 * @param[out]	IWORK	
          IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 * @param[out]	INFO	
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                       not positive definite, so the factorization
                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

           BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
      Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
      componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
      (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
      makes X(j) an exact solution).
  
 
  * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
  
           N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
      Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
      and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
      ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
  
 
  * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
  
           ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
      For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
      various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
      normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
 
      Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
              max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
             ------------------------------
                   max_j abs(X(j,i))
 
      The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
      below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
      returned.
 
      The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
      right-hand side.
 
      The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
      three fields:
      err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
               reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
               sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').
 
      err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
               almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
               so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
               sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
               be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
 
      err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
               reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
               sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
               estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
               numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
               appropriately scaled matrix Z.
               Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
               radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
 
      See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
      cautions.
  
 
  * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
  
           ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
      For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
      various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
      componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
 
      Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                     abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
              max_j ----------------------
                          abs(X(j,i))
 
      The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
      componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
      information as described below. There currently are up to three
      pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
      componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
      ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
      the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
 
      The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
      right-hand side.
 
      The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
      three fields:
      err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
               reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
               sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').
 
      err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
               almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
               so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
               sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
               be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
 
      err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
               reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
               sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
               estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
               numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
               appropriately scaled matrix Z.
               Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
               current right-hand side and S scales each row of
               A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
               sums of Z are approximately 1.

         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)

/*! @brief POSVX uses the Cholesky factorization to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     POSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
     compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
        A * X = B,
     where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
     are N-by-NRHS matrices.

     Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
     provided.

     \b Description:
      =================

     The following steps are performed:

     1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
        the system:
           diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
        Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
        scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
        overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

     2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
        factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
           A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
        matrix.

     3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
        then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
        form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
        A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
        precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
        still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
        described below.

     4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

     6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
        diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
        equilibration.

                  be modified.

          If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky

          the original system of equations.  Note that if EQUED = 'Y',
          A and B are modified on exit, and the solution to the
          equilibrated system is inv(diag(S))*X.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
 

 * @param[out] FERR
 
          FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)
 * @param[out]	IWORK	
          IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 * @param[out]	INFO	
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                       not positive definite, so the factorization
                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

/*! @brief POSVXX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for PO matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
    POSVXX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
    to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
    A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix
    and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. POSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    POSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    SPOSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what POSVXX would itself produce.

 *\b Description:
    =================
    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
    factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
    matrix.

    3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A (see argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number
    is less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
    for X and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.
    \endverbatim 
    
 * @param[in] FACT
 
          FACT is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
     supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
     equilibrated before it is factored.
       = 'F':  On entry, AF contains the factored form of A.
               If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
               equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
               A and AF are not modified.
       = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
       = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
               copied to AF and factored.
 

 * @param[in] UPLO
 
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
     matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
 

 * @param[in,out] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     On entry, the symmetric matrix A, except if FACT = 'F' and EQUED =
     'Y', then A must contain the equilibrated matrix
     diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper
     triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part of the
     matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not
     referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower triangular
     part of A contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A, and
     the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is
     not modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED =
     'N' on exit.

     On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
     diag(S)*A*diag(S).
 

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] AF
 
          AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
     contains the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same storage
     format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored
     form of the equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).

     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original
     matrix A.

     If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated
     matrix A (see the description of A for the form of the
     equilibrated matrix).
 

 * @param[in] LDAF
 
          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] EQUED
 
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
     output argument.
 

 * @param[in,out] S
 
          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.
 

 * @param[in,out] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
     On exit,
     if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
     if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;
 

 * @param[in] LDB
 
          LDB is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] X
 
          X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
     EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
     inv(diag(S))*X.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] RPVGRW
 
          RPVGRW is REAL
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in] NPARAMS
 
          NPARAMS is INTEGER
     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
 

 * @param[in,out] PARAMS
 
          PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
     are used for higher-numbered parameters.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0
            = 0.0:  No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                    computed.
            = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
            is true, 0.0 is false.
         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)
 * @param[out]	WORK	
          WORK is REAL array, dimension (4*N)
 * @param[out]	IWORK	
          IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 * @param[out]	INFO	
          INFO is INTEGER
       = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
         guaranteed.
       < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
       > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
         is returned.
       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     POTRF2 computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
     positive definite matrix A using the recursive algorithm.
    
     The factorization has the form
        A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
        A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
     where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
    
     This is the recursive version of the algorithm. It divides
     the matrix into four submatrices:
    
            [  A11 | A12  ]  where A11 is n1 by n1 and A22 is n2 by n2
        A = [ -----|----- ]  with n1 = n/2
            [  A21 | A22  ]       n2 = n-n1
    
     The subroutine calls itself to factor A11. Update and scale A21
     or A12, update A22 then call itself to factor A22.

        overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

     2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
        factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
           A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
        matrix.

     3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
        then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
        form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
        A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
        precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
        still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
        described below.

     4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

     6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
        diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
        equilibration.

          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
          The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is

          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.

          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)

          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as

          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                       not positive definite, so the factorization
                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

/*! @brief PTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     PTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
     symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
     matrix using SPTTRF, and then calling SBDSQR to compute the singular
     values of the bidiagonal factor.

     This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
     tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
     eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
     small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed
     more accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.

     The eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric positive definite matrix
     can also be found if SSYTRD, SSPTRD, or SSBTRD has been used to
     reduce this matrix to tridiagonal form. (The reduction to tridiagonal
     form, however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining high
     relative accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original matrix, if
     these eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)

/*! @brief PTSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for PT matrices

 * @details

    \endverbatim 

 * \b Description:
      ============
    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'N', the matrix A is factored as A = L*D*L**T, where L
       is a unit lower bidiagonal matrix and D is diagonal.  The
       factorization can also be regarded as having the form
       A = U**T*D*U.

    2. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
       then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
       form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
       A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
       precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
       still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
       described below.

    3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
       of A.

    4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
       matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
       for it.

     SBEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
     of a real symmetric band matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
     be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
     indices for the desired eigenvalues.

          AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB, N)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band

          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).

          On exit, AB is overwritten by values generated during the

          IU is INTEGER
          If RANGE='I', the index of the

 * @param[in] ABSTOL
 
          ABSTOL is REAL
          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
          of width less than or equal to

                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b|) ,

          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
          by reducing AB to tridiagonal form.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
          2*SLAMCH('S').

 * @param[out] W
 
          W is REAL array, dimension (N)

          ascending order.
 

 * @param[out] Z
 
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
 

 * @param[in] LDZ
 
          LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of

          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.

 * @param[in] LDZ
 
          LDZ is INTEGER

 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     SPGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
     of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
     A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
     B are assumed to be symmetric, stored in packed format, and B is also
     positive definite.
     If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

     The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
     floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
     digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
     digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
     Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
     without guard digits, but we know of none.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.

          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:

          if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.

/*! @brief SPSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for OTHER matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     SPSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization A = U*D*U**T or
     A = L*D*L**T to compute the solution to a real system of linear
     equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix stored
     in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

     Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
     provided.
     
     * \b Description:
       =================

     The following steps are performed:

     1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
           A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
        triangular matrices and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
        1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

     2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
        returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
        to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
        reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
        INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
        to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

     3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

          RCOND is REAL
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of

          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as

          overestimate of the true error.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     STEGR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
     of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T. Any such unreduced matrix has
     a well defined set of pairwise different real eigenvalues, the corresponding
     real eigenvectors are pairwise orthogonal.

     The spectrum may be computed either completely or partially by specifying
     either an interval (VL,VU] or a range of indices IL:IU for the desired
     eigenvalues.

     SSTEGR is a compatibility wrapper around the improved SSTEMR routine.
     See SSTEMR for further details.

     One important change is that the ABSTOL parameter no longer provides any
     benefit and hence is no longer used.

     Note : SSTEGR and SSTEMR work only on machines which follow
     IEEE-754 floating-point standard in their handling of infinities and
     NaNs.  Normal execution may create these exceptiona values and hence
     may abort due to a floating point exception in environments which
     do not conform to the IEEE-754 standard.

          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.

          The support of the eigenvectors in Z, i.e., the indices
          indicating the nonzero elements in Z. The i-th computed eigenvector
          is nonzero only in elements ISUPPZ( 2*i-1) through
          ISUPPZ( 2*i). This is relevant in the case when the matrix

/*! @brief STEVR computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for OTHER matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     STEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
     of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T.  Eigenvalues and
     eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a range of values
     or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

     Whenever possible, SSTEVR calls SSTEMR to compute the
     eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  SSTEMR
     computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
     eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
     (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
     orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
     the various steps of the algorithm are as follows. For the i-th
     unreduced block of T,
        (a) Compute T - sigma_i = L_i D_i L_i^T, such that L_i D_i L_i^T
             is a relatively robust representation,
        (b) Compute the eigenvalues, lambda_j, of L_i D_i L_i^T to high
            relative accuracy by the dqds algorithm,
        (c) If there is a cluster of close eigenvalues, "choose" sigma_i
            close to the cluster, and go to step (a),
        (d) Given the approximate eigenvalue lambda_j of L_i D_i L_i^T,
            compute the corresponding eigenvector by forming a
            rank-revealing twisted factorization.
     The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
     parameter ABSTOL.

     tridiagonal eigenvalue/eigenvector problem", by Inderjit Dhillon,
     Computer Science Division Technical Report No. UCB//CSD-97-971,

     Note 1 : SSTEVR calls SSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
     on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
     SSTEVR calls SSTEBZ and SSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
     when partial spectrum requests are made.

     Normal execution of SSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
     hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
     which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default

                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b|) ,

          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
          by reducing A to tridiagonal form.

          If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to

     SYEVD_2STAGE computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a

     divide and conquer algorithm.

     The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
     floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
     digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
     digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
     Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
     without guard digits, but we know of none.

/*! @brief SYEVR_2STAGE computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left \n
     and/or right eigenvectors for SY matrices
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     SYEVR_2STAGE computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
     of a real symmetric matrix A using the 2stage technique for
     the reduction to tridiagonal.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
     selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
     indices for the desired eigenvalues.

     SYEVR_2STAGE first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
     to SYTRD.  Then, whenever possible, SYEVR_2STAGE calls STEMR to compute
     the eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  STEMR
     computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
     eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
     (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
     orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
     the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.

     For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
        (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
            define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
            This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
            cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
            eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
            tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
        (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
            If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
            accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
            the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
        (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
            shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
            the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
            the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
            factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

     The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
     parameter ABSTOL.

     Note 1 : SSYEVR_2STAGE calls SSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
     on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
     SSYEVR_2STAGE calls SSTEBZ and SSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
     when partial spectrum requests are made.

     Normal execution of SSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
     hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
     which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
     manner.

          If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to
          SLAMCH( 'Safe minimum').  Doing so will guarantee that
          eigenvalues are computed to high relative accuracy when

          1:N because of the orthogonal transformations applied by SORMTR.

          On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper
          triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is

 * @param[in] ABSTOL
 
          ABSTOL is REAL
          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]

                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b|) ,

          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
          by reducing A to tridiagonal form.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
          2*SLAMCH('S').

          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
 

 * @param[out] W
 
          W is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
          eigenvalues in ascending order.
 

 * @param[out] Z
 
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
 

 * @param[in] LDZ
 
          LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if

          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.

          If RANGE='V', the upper bound of the interval to
          be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
 

 * @param[in] IL
 
          IL is INTEGER
          If RANGE='I', the index of the
          smallest eigenvalue to be returned.
          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
 

 * @param[in] IU
 
          IU is INTEGER
          If RANGE='I', the index of the
          largest eigenvalue to be returned.
          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
 

 * @param[in] ABSTOL
 
          ABSTOL is REAL
          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
          of width less than or equal to

                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b|) ,

          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
          by reducing C to tridiagonal form, where C is the symmetric
          matrix of the standard symmetric problem to which the
          generalized problem is transformed.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
          2*SLAMCH('S').
 

 * @param[out] M
 
          M is INTEGER
          The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
 

 * @param[out] W
 
          W is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
          eigenvalues in ascending order.
 

 * @param[out] Z
 
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
          if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
          if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.

          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
 

 * @param[in] LDZ
 
          LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] IFAIL
 
          IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
          IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.

 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
    SYRFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
    equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric indefinite, and
    provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
    solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides
    maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See comments for
    ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds.

    The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
    before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
    below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
    for the original unequilibrated system.

       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 

 * @param[in] EQUED
 
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
     the solution and error bounds correctly.
       = 'N':  No equilibration
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
     N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
     triangular part of A is not referenced.

     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in] AF
 
          AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
     diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
     factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A =
     L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.

          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).

          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
     as determined by SSYTRF.
 

 * @param[in,out] S
 
          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.
 

 * @param[in] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     The right hand side matrix B.

          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.

     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.

     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
     are used for higher-numbered parameters.

            refinement or not.

                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10

                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be

            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive

/*! @brief SYSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for SY matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
     SYSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
     solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B,
     where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
     matrices.

     Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
     provided.

     * \b Description:
         ==============
     The following steps are performed:

     1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
        The form of the factorization is
           A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
        triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
        1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

     2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
        returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
        to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
        reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
        INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
        to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

     3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)

/*! @brief  SYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the \n
    solution to a real system of linear equations

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
    SYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
    solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A
    is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. SSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    SSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    SSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what SYSVXX would itself produce.
 
 * \b Description:
      ============
    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
    the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

       A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

    3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
    routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
    is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
    argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
    less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
    for X and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.

 * @param[in] FACT
 
          FACT is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
     supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
     equilibrated before it is factored.
       = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
               If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
               equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
               A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
       = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
       = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
               copied to AF and factored.
 

 * @param[in] UPLO
 
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
     matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
 

 * @param[in,out] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
     N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
     triangular part of A is not referenced.

     On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
     diag(S)*A*diag(S).
 

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] AF
 
          AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
     contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
     used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
     U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.

     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
     used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
     U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.
 

 * @param[in] LDAF
 
          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in,out] IPIV
 
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
     If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
     contains details of the interchanges and the block
     structure of D, as determined by SSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0,
     then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
     D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
     IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
     -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
     diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0,
     then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
     and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

     If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
     contains details of the interchanges and the block
     structure of D, as determined by SSYTRF.
 

 * @param[in,out] EQUED
 
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
     output argument.
 

 * @param[in,out] S
 
          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.
 

 * @param[in,out] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
     On exit,
     if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
     if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;
 

 * @param[in] LDB
 
          LDB is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] X
 
          X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
     EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
     inv(diag(S))*X.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] RPVGRW
 
          RPVGRW is REAL
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.

            refinement or not.

                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive

/*! @brief HGEQZ computes the eigenvalues of a real matrix pair (H,T).

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
     HGEQZ computes the eigenvalues of a real matrix pair (H,T),
     where H is an upper Hessenberg matrix and T is upper triangular,
     using the double-shift QZ method.
     Matrix pairs of this type are produced by the reduction to
     generalized upper Hessenberg form of a real matrix pair (A,B):

        A = Q1*H*Z1**T,  B = Q1*T*Z1**T,

     as computed by SGGHRD.

     If JOB='S', then the Hessenberg-triangular pair (H,T) is
     also reduced to generalized Schur form,

        H = Q*S*Z**T,  T = Q*P*Z**T,

     where Q and Z are orthogonal matrices, P is an upper triangular
     matrix, and S is a quasi-triangular matrix with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2
     diagonal blocks.

     The 1-by-1 blocks correspond to real eigenvalues of the matrix pair
     (H,T) and the 2-by-2 blocks correspond to complex conjugate pairs of
     eigenvalues.

     Additionally, the 2-by-2 upper triangular diagonal blocks of P
     corresponding to 2-by-2 blocks of S are reduced to positive diagonal
     form, i.e., if S(j+1,j) is non-zero, then P(j+1,j) = P(j,j+1) = 0,
     P(j,j) > 0, and P(j+1,j+1) > 0.

     Optionally, the orthogonal matrix Q from the generalized Schur
     factorization may be postmultiplied into an input matrix Q1, and the
     orthogonal matrix Z may be postmultiplied into an input matrix Z1.
     If Q1 and Z1 are the orthogonal matrices from SGGHRD that reduced
     the matrix pair (A,B) to generalized upper Hessenberg form, then the
     output matrices Q1*Q and Z1*Z are the orthogonal factors from the
     generalized Schur factorization of (A,B):

        A = (Q1*Q)*S*(Z1*Z)**T,  B = (Q1*Q)*P*(Z1*Z)**T.

     To avoid overflow, eigenvalues of the matrix pair (H,T) (equivalently,
     of (A,B)) are computed as a pair of values (alpha,beta), where alpha is
     complex and beta real.
     If beta is nonzero, lambda = alpha / beta is an eigenvalue of the
     generalized nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem (GNEP)
        A*x = lambda*B*x
     and if alpha is nonzero, mu = beta / alpha is an eigenvalue of the
     alternate form of the GNEP
        mu*A*y = B*y.
     Real eigenvalues can be read directly from the generalized Schur
     form:
       alpha = S(i,i), beta = P(i,i).

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
     HSEIN uses inverse iteration to find specified right and/or left
     eigenvectors of a real upper Hessenberg matrix H.

     The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of the matrix H
     corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

                  H * x = w * x,     y**h * H = w * y**h

     where y**h denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
    \endverbatim  

 * @param[in] SIDE
 
          SIDE is CHARACTER*1
          = 'R': compute right eigenvectors only;
          = 'L': compute left eigenvectors only;
          = 'B': compute both right and left eigenvectors.
 

 * @param[in] EIGSRC
 
          EIGSRC is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the source of eigenvalues supplied in (WR,WI):
          = 'Q': the eigenvalues were found using SHSEQR; thus, if
                 H has zero subdiagonal elements, and so is
                 block-triangular, then the j-th eigenvalue can be
                 assumed to be an eigenvalue of the block containing
                 the j-th row/column.  This property allows SHSEIN to
                 perform inverse iteration on just one diagonal block.
          = 'N': no assumptions are made on the correspondence
                 between eigenvalues and diagonal blocks.  In this
                 case, SHSEIN must always perform inverse iteration
                 using the whole matrix H.

          eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
          (WR(j),WI(j)), with complex conjugate (WR(j+1),WI(j+1)),
          either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both must be set to

          On entry, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of
          H; a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues must be stored in
          consecutive elements of WR and WI.
          On exit, WR may have been altered since close eigenvalues
          are perturbed slightly in searching for independent
          eigenvectors.

          VL is REAL array, dimension (LDVL,MM)
          On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL must
          contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
          left eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
          must be in the same column(s) in which the eigenvector will
          be stored.
          On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', the left eigenvectors
          specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
          columns of VL, in the same order as their eigenvalues. A

          VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,MM)
          On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'R' or 'B', VR must
          contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the

          M is INTEGER
          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR required to
          store the eigenvectors; each selected real eigenvector
          occupies one column and each selected complex eigenvector
          occupies two columns.

          eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILL(i) = 0 if the
          eigenvector converged satisfactorily. If the i-th and (i+1)th
          columns of VL hold a complex eigenvector, then IFAILL(i) and

 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    HSEQR computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H
    and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition
    H = Z T Z**T, where T is an upper quasi-triangular matrix (the
    Schur form), and Z is the orthogonal matrix of Schur vectors.

    Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input orthogonal
    matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization
    of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H
    by the orthogonal matrix Q:  A = Q*H*Q**T = (QZ)*T*(QZ)**T.

           = 'V':  Z must contain an orthogonal matrix Q on entry, and
                   the product Q*Z is returned.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
           The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] ILO
 
          ILO is INTEGER
 

 * @param[in] IHI
 
          IHI is INTEGER

           It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows
           and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N. ILO and IHI are normally
           set by a previous call to SGEBAL, and then passed to ZGEHRD
           when the matrix output by SGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg
           form. Otherwise ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N
           respectively.  If N > 0, then 1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N.
           If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.
 

 * @param[in,out] H
 
          H is REAL array, dimension (LDH,N)
           On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
           On exit, if INFO = 0 and JOB = 'S', then H contains the
           upper quasi-triangular matrix T from the Schur decomposition
           (the Schur form); 2-by-2 diagonal blocks (corresponding to
           complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues) are returned in
           standard form, with H(i,i) = H(i+1,i+1) and
           H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1) < 0. If INFO = 0 and JOB = 'E', the

          WR is REAL array, dimension (N)
 

 * @param[out] WI
 
          WI is REAL array, dimension (N)

           The real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the computed
           eigenvalues. If two eigenvalues are computed as a complex
           conjugate pair, they are stored in consecutive elements of
           WR and WI, say the i-th and (i+1)th, with WI(i) > 0 and
           WI(i+1) < 0. If JOB = 'S', the eigenvalues are stored in
           the same order as on the diagonal of the Schur form returned
           in H, with WR(i) = H(i,i) and, if H(i:i+1,i:i+1) is a 2-by-2
           diagonal block, WI(i) = sqrt(-H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1)) and
           WI(i+1) = -WI(i).
 

 * @param[in,out] Z
 
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ,N)
           If COMPZ = 'N', Z is not referenced.
           If COMPZ = 'I', on entry Z need not be set and on exit,
           if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthogonal matrix Z of the Schur
           vectors of H.  If COMPZ = 'V', on entry Z must contain an
           N-by-N matrix Q, which is assumed to be equal to the unit
           matrix except for the submatrix Z(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI). On exit,
           if INFO = 0, Z contains Q*Z.
           Normally Q is the orthogonal matrix generated by SORGHR
           after the call to SGEHRD which formed the Hessenberg matrix
           H. (The output value of Z when INFO > 0 is given under

/*! @brief TGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation

 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
     TGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

                 A * R - L * B = scale * C                 (1)
                 D * R - L * E = scale * F

     where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
     (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
     respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E) must be in
     generalized (real) Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper quasi
     triangular and D, E are upper triangular.

     The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1 is an output
     scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

     In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve  Zx = scale b, where
     Z is defined as

                Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]         (2)
                    [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ].

     Here Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of
     X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

     If TRANS = 'T', STGSYL solves the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b,
     which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

                 A**T * R + D**T * L = scale * C           (3)
                 R * B**T + L * E**T = scale * -F

     This case (TRANS = 'T') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
     of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
     and (B,E), using SLACON.

     If IJOB >= 1, STGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate
     of Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
     reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z. See [1-2] for more
     information.

     This is a level 3 BLAS algorithm.

          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as

     Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
     a real general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**T, as computed by SHSEQR.

     The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
     to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

        T*x = w*x,     (y**H)*T = w*(y**H)

     The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
     from the diagonal blocks of T.

     This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
     eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
     input matrix.  If Q is the orthogonal factor that reduces a matrix

/*! @brief LATMS generates random matrices with specified singular values \n
     for testing LAPACK programs
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LATMS generates random matrices with specified singular values
     (or symmetric/hermitian with specified eigenvalues)
     for testing LAPACK programs.
 
     SLATMS operates by applying the following sequence of
     operations:
 
       Set the diagonal to D, where D may be input or
          computed according to MODE, COND, DMAX, and SYM
          as described below.
 
       Generate a matrix with the appropriate band structure, by one
          of two methods:
 
       Method A:
           Generate a dense M x N matrix by multiplying D on the left
               and the right by random unitary matrices, then:
 
           Reduce the bandwidth according to KL and KU, using
           Householder transformations.
 
       Method B:
           Convert the bandwidth-0 (i.e., diagonal) matrix to a
               bandwidth-1 matrix using Givens rotations, "chasing"
               out-of-band elements back, much as in QR; then
               convert the bandwidth-1 to a bandwidth-2 matrix, etc.
               Note that for reasonably small bandwidths (relative to
               M and N) this requires less storage, as a dense matrix
               is not generated.  Also, for symmetric matrices, only
               one triangle is generated.
 
       Method A is chosen if the bandwidth is a large fraction of the
           order of the matrix, and LDA is at least M (so a dense
           matrix can be stored.)  Method B is chosen if the bandwidth
           is small (< 1/2 N for symmetric, < .3 N+M for
           non-symmetric), or LDA is less than M and not less than the
           bandwidth.
 
       Pack the matrix if desired. Options specified by PACK are:
          no packing
          zero out upper half (if symmetric)
          zero out lower half (if symmetric)
          store the upper half columnwise (if symmetric or upper
                triangular)
          store the lower half columnwise (if symmetric or lower
                triangular)
          store the lower triangle in banded format (if symmetric
                or lower triangular)
          store the upper triangle in banded format (if symmetric
                or upper triangular)
          store the entire matrix in banded format
       If Method B is chosen, and band format is specified, then the
          matrix will be generated in the band format, so no repacking
          will be necessary.

  * @param[in] DIST
  
           DIST is CHARACTER*1
            On entry, DIST specifies the type of distribution to be used
            to generate the random eigen-/singular values.
            'U' => UNIFORM( 0, 1)  ( 'U' for uniform)

            Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in,out] ISEED
  
           ISEED is INTEGER array, dimension ( 4)
            On entry ISEED specifies the seed of the random number
            generator. They should lie between 0 and 4095 inclusive,
            and ISEED(4) should be odd. The random number generator
            uses a linear congruential sequence limited to small
            integers, and so should produce machine independent
            random numbers. The values of ISEED are changed on
            exit, and can be used in the next call to SLATMS
            to continue the same random number sequence.
            Changed on exit.
  
 
  * @param[in] SYM
  
           SYM is CHARACTER*1
            If SYM='S' or 'H', the generated matrix is symmetric, with
              eigenvalues specified by D, COND, MODE, and DMAX; they
              may be positive, negative, or zero.
            If SYM='P', the generated matrix is symmetric, with
              eigenvalues (= singular values) specified by D, COND,
              MODE, and DMAX; they will not be negative.
            If SYM='N', the generated matrix is nonsymmetric, with
              singular values specified by D, COND, MODE, and DMAX;
              they will not be negative.
            Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in,out] D
  
           D is REAL array, dimension ( MIN( M , N))
            This array is used to specify the singular values or
            eigenvalues of A (see SYM, above.)  If MODE=0, then D is
            assumed to contain the singular/eigenvalues, otherwise
            they will be computed according to MODE, COND, and DMAX,
            and placed in D.
            Modified if MODE is nonzero.
  
 
  * @param[in] MODE
  
           MODE is INTEGER
            On entry this describes how the singular/eigenvalues are to
            be specified:
            MODE = 0 means use D as input
            MODE = 1 sets D(1)=1 and D(2:N)=1.0/COND
            MODE = 2 sets D(1:N-1)=1 and D(N)=1.0/COND
            MODE = 3 sets D(I)=COND**(-(I-1)/(N-1))
            MODE = 4 sets D(i)=1 - (i-1)/(N-1)*(1 - 1/COND)
            MODE = 5 sets D to random numbers in the range
                     ( 1/COND , 1) such that their logarithms
                     are uniformly distributed.
            MODE = 6 set D to random numbers from same distribution
                     as the rest of the matrix.
            MODE < 0 has the same meaning as ABS(MODE), except that
               the order of the elements of D is reversed.
            Thus if MODE is positive, D has entries ranging from
               1 to 1/COND, if negative, from 1/COND to 1,
            If SYM='S' or 'H', and MODE is neither 0, 6, nor -6, then
               the elements of D will also be multiplied by a random
               sign (i.e., +1 or -1.)
            Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in] COND
  
           COND is REAL
            On entry, this is used as described under MODE above.
            If used, it must be >= 1. Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in] DMAX
  
           DMAX is REAL
            If MODE is neither -6, 0 nor 6, the contents of D, as
            computed according to MODE and COND, will be scaled by
            DMAX / max(abs(D(i))); thus, the maximum absolute eigen- or
            singular value (which is to say the norm) will be abs(DMAX).
            Note that DMAX need not be positive: if DMAX is negative
            (or zero), D will be scaled by a negative number (or zero).
            Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in] KL
  
           KL is INTEGER
            This specifies the lower bandwidth of the  matrix. For
            example, KL=0 implies upper triangular, KL=1 implies upper
            Hessenberg, and KL being at least M-1 means that the matrix
            has full lower bandwidth.  KL must equal KU if the matrix
            is symmetric.
            Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in] KU
  
           KU is INTEGER
            This specifies the upper bandwidth of the  matrix. For
            example, KU=0 implies lower triangular, KU=1 implies lower
            Hessenberg, and KU being at least N-1 means that the matrix
            has full upper bandwidth.  KL must equal KU if the matrix
            is symmetric.
            Not modified.
  
 
  * @param[in] PACK
  
           PACK is CHARACTER*1
            This specifies packing of matrix as follows:
            'N' => no packing
            'U' => zero out all subdiagonal entries (if symmetric)
            'L' => zero out all superdiagonal entries (if symmetric)
            'C' => store the upper triangle columnwise
                   (only if the matrix is symmetric or upper triangular)
            'R' => store the lower triangle columnwise
                   (only if the matrix is symmetric or lower triangular)
            'B' => store the lower triangle in band storage scheme

            packed or banded storage scheme, all LDA elements of the
            first N columns will be modified; the elements of the

            be at least MIN( KL, M-1) (which is equal to MIN(KU,N-1)).

/*! @brief HEEVR_2STAGE computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for HE matrices

 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
     HEEVR_2STAGE computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
     of a complex Hermitian matrix A using the 2stage technique for
     the reduction to tridiagonal.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
     be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
     indices for the desired eigenvalues.

     CHEEVR_2STAGE first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
     to CHETRD.  Then, whenever possible, CHEEVR_2STAGE calls CSTEMR to compute
     eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  CSTEMR
     computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
     eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
     (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
     orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
     the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.

     For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
        (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
            define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
            This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
            cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
            eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
            tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
        (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
            If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
            accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
            the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
        (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
            shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
            the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
            the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
            factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

     The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
     parameter ABSTOL.

     Note 1 : CHEEVR_2STAGE calls CSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
     on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
     CHEEVR_2STAGE calls SSTEBZ and CSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
     when partial spectrum requests are made.

     Normal execution of CSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
     hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
     which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
     manner.

          If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to
          SLAMCH( 'Safe minimum').  Doing so will guarantee that
          eigenvalues are computed to high relative accuracy when
          possible in future releases.  The current code does not
          make any guarantees about high relative accuracy, but
          future releases will. See J. Barlow and J. Demmel,
          "Computing Accurate Eigensystems of Scaled Diagonally
          Dominant Matrices", LAPACK Working Note #7, for a discussion
          of which matrices define their eigenvalues to high relative
          accuracy.

          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are

          is nonzero only in elements ISUPPZ( 2*i-1) through
          ISUPPZ( 2*i). This is an output of CSTEMR (tridiagonal

          1:N because of the unitary transformations applied by CUNMTR.

    \verbatim 
    HEGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
    of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
    A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
    B are assumed to be Hermitian and B is also positive definite.
    If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

    The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
    floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
    digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
    digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
    Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
    without guard digits, but we know of none.

          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
          by reducing C to tridiagonal form, where C is the symmetric
          matrix of the standard symmetric problem to which the
          generalized problem is transformed.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some

          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
          if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
          if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.

          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.

 * @param[out] IFAIL
 
          IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
          IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.

               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] A
 
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
     The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
     N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
     triangular part of A is not referenced.
 

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in] AF
 
          AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
     diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
     factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A =
     L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.
 

 * @param[in] LDAF
 
          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in] IPIV
 
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
     as determined by SSYTRF.
 

 * @param[in,out] S
 
          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.
 

 * @param[in] B
 
          B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     The right hand side matrix B.

     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGETRS.
     On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error

              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.

     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the

     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then

     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
     are used for higher-numbered parameters.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0

                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive

/*! @brief HESVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for HE matrices

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
     HESVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
     solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B,
     where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS

     provided.
     
     * \b Description:
       =================

     The following steps are performed:

     1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
        The form of the factorization is
           A = U * D * U**H,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L * D * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',

        triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
        1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

     2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
        returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
        to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
        reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
        INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
        to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

     3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
        of A.

     4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
        matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
        for it.

    A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
    matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. CHESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    CHESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    CHESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what CHESVXX would itself produce.
 
 * \b Description:
    =================

    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
    the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

       A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

    3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
    routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
    is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
    argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
    less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
    for X and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.

     -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
     diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0,
     then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
     and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

     If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
     contains details of the interchanges and the block
     structure of D, as determined by CHETRF.
 

 * @param[in,out] EQUED
 
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
     output argument.
 

 * @param[in,out] S
 
          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.
 

 * @param[in,out] B
 
          B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
     On exit,
     if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
     if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;
 

 * @param[in] LDB
 
          LDB is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] X
 
          X is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
     EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
     inv(diag(S))*X.
 

 * @param[in] LDX
 
          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[out] RPVGRW
 
          RPVGRW is REAL
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.
 

 * @param[out] BERR
 
          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).
 

 * @param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
 
          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in] NPARAMS
 
          NPARAMS is INTEGER
     Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If <= 0, the
     PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
 

 * @param[in,out] PARAMS
 
          PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
     Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is < 0.0, then
     that entry will be filled with default value used for that
     parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
     are used for higher-numbered parameters.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0

                    computed.
            = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                    compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                    PRECISION.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
            is true, 0.0 is false.
         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)

          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
          Hermitian matrix A is stored:
          = 'U':  Upper triangular


 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.


 * @param[in,out] A
 
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.
            If UPLO = 'U': the leading N-by-N upper triangular part
            of A contains the upper triangular part of the matrix A,
            and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not
            referenced.

            If UPLO = 'L': the leading N-by-N lower triangular part
            of A contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A,
            and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
            referenced.

          On exit, contains:
            a) ONLY diagonal elements of the Hermitian block diagonal
               matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);
               (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D
                are stored on exit in array E), and
            b) If UPLO = 'U': factor U in the superdiagonal part of A.

 * @param[in] LDA
 
          LDA is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).


 * @param[out] E
 
          E is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
          On exit, contains the superdiagonal (or subdiagonal)
          elements of the Hermitian block diagonal matrix D

          If UPLO = 'L': E(i) = D(i+1,i), i=1:N-1, E(N) is set to 0.

          NOTE: For 1-by-1 diagonal block D(k), where

          represents the index of row and column that were
          interchanged with the k-th row and column. The value of UPLO
          describes the order in which the interchanges were applied.
          Also, the sign of IPIV represents the block structure of
          the Hermitian block diagonal matrix D with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2
          diagonal blocks which correspond to 1 or 2 interchanges
          at each factorization step. For more info see Further

            c) In both cases a) and b), always ABS( IPIV(k)) <= k.

            d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.

          ( in factorization order, k increases from 1 to N):
            a) A single positive entry IPIV(k) > 0 means:
               D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

               interchanged in the matrix A(1:N,1:N).
               If IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.

            b) A pair of consecutive negative entries
               IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k+1) < 0 means:
               D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    GSVJ1 is called from SGESVJ as a pre-processor and that is its main

    (stopping criterion). Few tunning parameters (marked by [TP]) are
    available for the implementer.

    Further Details
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    SGSVJ1 applies few sweeps of Jacobi rotations in the column space of
    the input M-by-N matrix A. The pivot pairs are taken from the (1,2)
    off-diagonal block in the corresponding N-by-N Gram matrix A^T * A. The
    block-entries (tiles) of the (1,2) off-diagonal block are marked by the
    [x]'s in the following scheme:

       | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|
       | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cycling in the nblr-by-nblc [x] blocks.
       | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cyclic pivoting inside each [x] block.
       |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
       |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
       |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |

    In terms of the columns of A, the first N1 columns are rotated 'against'
    the remaining N-N1 columns, trying to increase the angle between the
    corresponding subspaces. The off-diagonal block is N1-by(N-N1) and it is
    tiled using quadratic tiles of side KBL. Here, KBL is a tunning parameter.
    The number of sweeps is given in NSWEEP and the orthogonality threshold

/*! @brief TGSY2 solves the generalized Sylvester equation (unblocked algorithm)

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    TGSY2 solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

                A * R - L * B = scale * C                (1)
                D * R - L * E = scale * F,

    using Level 1 and 2 BLAS. where R and L are unknown M-by-N matrices,
    (A, D), (B, E) and (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size M-by-M,
    N-by-N and M-by-N, respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E)
    must be in generalized Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper
    quasi triangular and D, E are upper triangular. The solution (R, L)
    overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1 is an output scaling factor
    chosen to avoid overflow.

    In matrix notation solving equation (1) corresponds to solve
    Z*x = scale*b, where Z is defined as

           Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]             (2)
               [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ],

    Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of X.
    kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.
    In the process of solving (1), we solve a number of such systems
    where Dim(In), Dim(In) = 1 or 2.

    If TRANS = 'T', solve the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b for y,
    which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

                A**T * R  + D**T * L   = scale * C           (3)
                R  * B**T + L  * E**T  = scale * -F

    This case is used to compute an estimate of Dif[(A, D), (B, E)] =
    sigma_min(Z) using reverse communication with SLACON.

    STGSY2 also (IJOB >= 1) contributes to the computation in STGSYL
    of an upper bound on the separation between to matrix pairs. Then
    the input (A, D), (B, E) are sub-pencils of the matrix pair in
    STGSYL. See STGSYL for details.

/*! @brief TREVC3 computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors \n

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    TREVC3 computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
    a complex upper triangular matrix T.
    Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
    a complex general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**H, as computed by CHSEQR.

    The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
    to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

                 T*x = w*x,    (y**H)*T = w*(y**H)

    where y**H denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
    The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
    from the diagonal of T.

    This routine   returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
    eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
    input matrix. If Q is the unitary factor that reduces a matrix A to
    Schur form T, then Q*X and Q*Y are the matrices of right and left
    eigenvectors of A.

    This uses a Level 3 BLAS version of the back transformation.

    X11 is P-by-Q, and X21 is (M-P)-by-Q. M-Q must be no larger than P,

    which M-Q is not the minimum dimension.

    The orthogonal matrices P1, P2, and Q1 are P-by-P, (M-P)-by-(M-P),
    and (M-Q)-by-(M-Q), respectively. They are represented implicitly by
    Householder vectors.

    B11 and B12 are (M-Q)-by-(M-Q) bidiagonal matrices represented
    implicitly by angles THETA, PHI.

    errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,

            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
       returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold

              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.
     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information   returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are   returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.
     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in] RES
 
          RES is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace to hold the intermediate residual.

          AYB is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace. This can be the same workspace passed for Y_TAIL.
 

 * @param[in] DY
 
          DY is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace to hold the intermediate solution.

          Y_TAIL is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace to hold the trailing bits of the intermediate solution.
 

 * @param[in] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[in] ITHRESH
 
          ITHRESH is INTEGER
     The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
     refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
     permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
     factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
     technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
     ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.
 

 * @param[in] RTHRESH
 
          RTHRESH is REAL
     Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
     decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
     satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) < RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
     the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 < RTHRESH <= 1. The
     default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
     convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
     for more details.
 

 * @param[in] DZ_UB
 
          DZ_UB is REAL
     Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
     Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
     of the solution Y is stable, which we definte as the relative
     change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
     is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
     more details.
 

 * @param[in] IGNORE_CWISE
 
          IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
     If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
     is .FALSE..
 

 * @param[out] INFO
 
          INFO is INTEGER
       = 0:  Successful exit.
       < 0:  if INFO = -i, the ith argument to SGBTRS had an illegal
             value

     of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
     Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
     the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.

                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
       returned.

     The first index in ERRS_N(i,:) corresponds to the ith

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     pieces of information   returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERRS_C is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are   returned.

     The first index in ERRS_C(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERRS_C(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:

          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular

     The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
     refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
     permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
     factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
     technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
     ERRS_N and ERRS_C may no longer be trustworthy.

          RTHRESH is REAL

     decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
     satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) < RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
     the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 < RTHRESH <= 1. The

     Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
     of the solution Y is stable, which we definte as the relative
     change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
     is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
     more details.

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LA_PORFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
    linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
    and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
    This subroutine is called by SPORFSX to perform iterative refinement.
    In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
    componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
    and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
    subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
    ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.
    \endverbatim  

 * @param[in] PREC_TYPE
 
          PREC_TYPE is INTEGER
     Specifies the intermediate precision to be used in refinement.
     The value is defined by ILAPREC(P) where P is a CHARACTER and P
          = 'S':  Single
          = 'D':  Double
          = 'I':  Indigenous
          = 'X' or 'E':  Extra
 

 * @param[in] UPLO
 
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
     matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
     matrix B.
 

 * @param[in] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.

          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

     A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by SPOTRF.
 

 * @param[in] LDAF
 
          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[in] COLEQU
 
          COLEQU is LOGICAL
     If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
     this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
     bounds correctly.
 

 * @param[in] C
 
          C is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
     is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
     of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
     Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
     the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.

     The right-hand-side matrix B.

     On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
     error for right-hand-side j from the formula
         max(i) (abs(RES(i)) / (abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s))(i))
     where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
     or vector Z. This is computed by SLA_LIN_BERR.
 

 * @param[in] N_NORMS
 
          N_NORMS is INTEGER
     Determines which error bounds to   return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
     and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
     If N_NORMS >= 1   return normwise error bounds.
     If N_NORMS >= 2   return componentwise error bounds.

          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
       returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only

              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.
     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information   returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are   returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     Workspace to hold the intermediate residual.
 

 * @param[in] AYB
 
          AYB is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace. This can be the same workspace passed for Y_TAIL.
 

 * @param[in] DY
 
          DY is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace to hold the intermediate solution.

     Workspace to hold the trailing bits of the intermediate solution.
 

 * @param[in] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[in] ITHRESH
 
          ITHRESH is INTEGER
     The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
     refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
     permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
     factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
     technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
     ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.
 

 * @param[in] RTHRESH
 
          RTHRESH is REAL
     Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops

    \verbatim 
    LA_SYRFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
    linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
    and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
    This subroutine is called by SSYRFSX to perform iterative refinement.
    In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
    componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
    and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
    subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
    ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.
    \endverbatim

          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
     matrix A.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] NRHS
 
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
     matrix B.
 

 * @param[in] A
 
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
     On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.

          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
     as determined by SSYTRF.
 

 * @param[in] COLEQU
 
          COLEQU is LOGICAL
     If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
     this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
     bounds correctly.
 

 * @param[in] C
 
          C is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
     is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
     of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
     Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
     the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.
 

 * @param[in] B
 
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     The right-hand-side matrix B.

     On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
     error for right-hand-side j from the formula
         max(i) (abs(RES(i)) / (abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s))(i))
     where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
     or vector Z. This is computed by SLA_LIN_BERR.
 

 * @param[in] N_NORMS
 
          N_NORMS is INTEGER
     Determines which error bounds to   return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
     and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
     If N_NORMS >= 1   return normwise error bounds.
     If N_NORMS >= 2   return componentwise error bounds.
 

 * @param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
 
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
       returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.
     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information   returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are   returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.
     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.
 

 * @param[in] RES
 
          RES is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace to hold the intermediate residual.
 

 * @param[in] AYB
 
          AYB is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace. This can be the same workspace passed for Y_TAIL.
 

 * @param[in] DY
 
          DY is REAL array, dimension (N)
     Workspace to hold the intermediate solution.

     Workspace to hold the trailing bits of the intermediate solution.
 

 * @param[in] RCOND
 
          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[in] ITHRESH
 
          ITHRESH is INTEGER
     The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
     refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
     permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
     factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
     technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
     ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.
 

 * @param[in] RTHRESH
 
          RTHRESH is REAL
     Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
     decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
     satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) < RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
     the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 < RTHRESH <= 1. The
     default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
     convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
     for more details.
 

 * @param[in] DZ_UB
 
          DZ_UB is REAL
     Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
     Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
     of the solution Y is stable, which we definte as the relative
     change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
     is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
     more details.
 

 * @param[in] IGNORE_CWISE
 
          IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
     If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
     is .FALSE..
 

 * @param[out] INFO
 
          INFO is INTEGER
       = 0:  Successful exit.
       < 0:  if INFO = -i, the ith argument to SLA_SYRFSX_EXTENDED had an illegal

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith

              appropriately scaled matrix Z.

 * @param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
 
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information   returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are   returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise

              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.
 

 * @param[in] ITHRESH
 
          ITHRESH is INTEGER
     The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
     refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
     permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
     factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
     technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
     ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.
 

 * @param[in] RTHRESH
 
          RTHRESH is REAL
     Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
     decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
     satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) < RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
     the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 < RTHRESH <= 1. The
     default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
     convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
     for more details.
 

 * @param[in] DZ_UB
 
          DZ_UB is REAL
     Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
     Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
     of the solution Y is stable, which we definte as the relative
     change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
     is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
     more details.
 

 * @param[in] IGNORE_CWISE
 
          IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
     If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
     is .FALSE..

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LAEBZ contains the iteration loops which compute and use the
    function N(w), which is the count of eigenvalues of a symmetric
    tridiagonal matrix T less than or equal to its argument  w.  It
    performs a choice of two types of loops:

    IJOB=1, followed by
    IJOB=2: It takes as input a list of intervals and   returns a list of
            sufficiently small intervals whose union contains the same
            eigenvalues as the union of the original intervals.
            The input intervals are (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)], j=1,...,MINP.
            The output interval (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] will contain
            eigenvalues NAB(j,1)+1,...,NAB(j,2), where 1 <= j <= MOUT.

    IJOB=3: It performs a binary search in each input interval
            (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] for a point  w(j)  such that
            N(w(j))=NVAL(j), and uses  C(j)  as the starting point of
            the search.  If such a w(j) is found, then on output
            AB(j,1)=AB(j,2)=w.  If no such w(j) is found, then on output
            (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] will be a small interval containing the
            point where N(w) jumps through NVAL(j), unless that point
            lies outside the initial interval.

    Note that the intervals are in all cases half-open intervals,
    i.e., of the form  (a,b] , which includes  b  but not  a .

    To avoid underflow, the matrix should be scaled so that its largest
    element is no greater than  overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4)
    in absolute value.  To assure the most accurate computation
    of small eigenvalues, the matrix should be scaled to be
    not much smaller than that, either.

 * @param[in] IJOB
 
          IJOB is INTEGER
          Specifies what is to be done:
          = 1:  Compute NAB for the initial intervals.
          = 2:  Perform bisection iteration to find eigenvalues of T.
          = 3:  Perform bisection iteration to invert N(w), i.e.,
                to find a point which has a specified number of
                eigenvalues of T to its left.
          Other values will cause SLAEBZ to   return with INFO=-1.
 

 * @param[in] NITMAX
 
          NITMAX is INTEGER
          The maximum number of "levels" of bisection to be
          performed, i.e., an interval of width W will not be made
          smaller than 2^(-NITMAX) * W.  If not all intervals
          have converged after NITMAX iterations, then INFO is set
          to the number of non-converged intervals.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
          The dimension n of the tridiagonal matrix T.  It must be at
          least 1.
 

 * @param[in] MMAX
 
          MMAX is INTEGER
          The maximum number of intervals.  If more than MMAX intervals
          are generated, then SLAEBZ will quit with INFO=MMAX+1.
 

 * @param[in] MINP
 
          MINP is INTEGER
          The initial number of intervals.  It may not be greater than
          MMAX.
 

 * @param[in] NBMIN
 
          NBMIN is INTEGER
          The smallest number of intervals that should be processed
          using a vector loop.  If zero, then only the scalar loop
          will be used.
 

 * @param[in] ABSTOL
 
          ABSTOL is REAL
          The minimum (absolute) width of an interval.  When an
          interval is narrower than ABSTOL, or than RELTOL times the
          larger (in magnitude) endpoint, then it is considered to be
          sufficiently small, i.e., converged.  This must be at least
          zero.
 

 * @param[in] RELTOL
 
          RELTOL is REAL
          The minimum relative width of an interval.  When an interval
          is narrower than ABSTOL, or than RELTOL times the larger (in
          magnitude) endpoint, then it is considered to be
          sufficiently small, i.e., converged.  Note: this should
          always be at least radix*machine epsilon.
 

 * @param[in] PIVMIN
 
          PIVMIN is REAL
          The minimum absolute value of a "pivot" in the Sturm
          sequence loop.
          This must be at least  max |e(j)**2|*safe_min  and at
          least safe_min, where safe_min is at least
          the smallest number that can divide one without overflow.
 

 * @param[in] D
 
          D is REAL array, dimension (N)
          The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
 

 * @param[in] E
 
          E is REAL array, dimension (N)
          The offdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T in
          positions 1 through N-1.  E(N) is arbitrary.
 

 * @param[in] E2
 
          E2 is REAL array, dimension (N)
          The squares of the offdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
          matrix T.  E2(N) is ignored.
 

 * @param[in,out] NVAL
 
          NVAL is INTEGER array, dimension (MINP)
          If IJOB=1 or 2, not referenced.
          If IJOB=3, the desired values of N(w).  The elements of NVAL
          will be reordered to correspond with the intervals in AB.
          Thus, NVAL(j) on output will not, in general be the same as
          NVAL(j) on input, but it will correspond with the interval
          (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] on output.
 

 * @param[in,out] AB
 
          AB is REAL array, dimension (MMAX,2)
          The endpoints of the intervals.  AB(j,1) is  a(j), the left
          endpoint of the j-th interval, and AB(j,2) is b(j), the
          right endpoint of the j-th interval.  The input intervals
          will, in general, be modified, split, and reordered by the
          calculation.
 

 * @param[in,out] C
 
          C is REAL array, dimension (MMAX)
          If IJOB=1, ignored.
          If IJOB=2, workspace.
          If IJOB=3, then on input C(j) should be initialized to the
          first search point in the binary search.
 

 * @param[out] MOUT
 
          MOUT is INTEGER
          If IJOB=1, the number of eigenvalues in the intervals.
          If IJOB=2 or 3, the number of intervals output.
          If IJOB=3, MOUT will equal MINP.
 

 * @param[in,out] NAB
 
          NAB is INTEGER array, dimension (MMAX,2)
          If IJOB=1, then on output NAB(i,j) will be set to N(AB(i,j)).
          If IJOB=2, then on input, NAB(i,j) should be set.  It must
             satisfy the condition:
             N(AB(i,1)) <= NAB(i,1) <= NAB(i,2) <= N(AB(i,2)),
             which means that in interval i only eigenvalues
             NAB(i,1)+1,...,NAB(i,2) will be considered.  Usually,
             NAB(i,j)=N(AB(i,j)), from a previous call to SLAEBZ with
             IJOB=1.
             On output, NAB(i,j) will contain
             max(na(k),min(nb(k),N(AB(i,j)))), where k is the index of
             the input interval that the output interval
             (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] came from, and na(k) and nb(k) are the
             the input values of NAB(k,1) and NAB(k,2).
          If IJOB=3, then on output, NAB(i,j) contains N(AB(i,j)),
             unless N(w) > NVAL(i) for all search points  w , in which
             case NAB(i,1) will not be modified, i.e., the output
             value will be the same as the input value (modulo
             reorderings -- see NVAL and AB), or unless N(w) < NVAL(i)
             for all search points  w , in which case NAB(i,2) will
             not be modified.  Normally, NAB should be set to some
             distinctive value(s) before SLAEBZ is called.

     original matrix is tridiagonal
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LAED1 computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal
    matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix.  This
    routine is used only for the eigenproblem which requires all
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix.  SLAED7 handles
    the case in which eigenvalues only or eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    of a full symmetric matrix (which was reduced to tridiagonal form)
    are desired.

      T = Q(in) (D(in) + RHO * Z*Z**T) Q**T(in) = Q(out) * D(out) * Q**T(out)

       where Z = Q**T*u, u is a vector of length N with ones in the
       CUTPNT and CUTPNT + 1 th elements and zeros elsewhere.

       The eigenvectors of the original matrix are stored in Q, and the
       eigenvalues are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

          The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
          when there are multiple eigenvalues or if there is a zero in
          the Z vector.  For each such occurrence the dimension of the
          secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
          performed by the routine SLAED2.

          The second stage consists of calculating the updated
          eigenvalues. This is done by finding the roots of the secular
          equation via the routine SLAED4 (as called by SLAED3).
          This routine also calculates the eigenvectors of the current
          problem.

          The final stage consists of computing the updated eigenvectors
          directly using the updated eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors for
          the current problem are multiplied with the eigenvectors from
          the overall problem.

    add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard digits
    which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or Cray-2.

/*! @brief LAED7 used by sstedc. Computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal \n
     matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix. Used when the    \n
     original matrix is dense
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LAED7 computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal
    matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix. This
    routine is used only for the eigenproblem which requires all
    eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors of a dense symmetric matrix
    that has been reduced to tridiagonal form.  SLAED1 handles
    the case in which all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric
    tridiagonal matrix are desired.

      T = Q(in) (D(in) + RHO * Z*Z**T) Q**T(in) = Q(out) * D(out) * Q**T(out)

       where Z = Q**Tu, u is a vector of length N with ones in the
       CUTPNT and CUTPNT + 1 th elements and zeros elsewhere.

       The eigenvectors of the original matrix are stored in Q, and the
       eigenvalues are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

          The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
          when there are multiple eigenvalues or if there is a zero in
          the Z vector.  For each such occurrence the dimension of the
          secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
          performed by the routine SLAED8.

          The second stage consists of calculating the updated
          eigenvalues. This is done by finding the roots of the secular
          equation via the routine SLAED4 (as called by SLAED9).
          This routine also calculates the eigenvectors of the current
          problem.

          The final stage consists of computing the updated eigenvectors
          directly using the updated eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors for
          the current problem are multiplied with the eigenvectors from
          the overall problem.

          diagonals should be at least sqrt(SAFMIN) times the largest
          element of B (in absolute value); if a diagonal is smaller
          than that, then  +/- sqrt(SAFMIN) will be used instead of

          the first (real) eigenvalue is  WR1 / SCALE1 , but this may
          overflow or underflow, and in fact, SCALE1 may be zero or

          the eigenvalues are complex, then SCALE2=SCALE1.  If the
          eigenvalues are real, then the second (real) eigenvalue is
          WR2 / SCALE2 , but this may overflow or underflow, and in
          fact, SCALE2 may be zero or less than the underflow
          threshold if the exact eigenvalue is sufficiently large.

          WR2 is REAL
          If the eigenvalue is real, then WR2 is SCALE2 times the

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LAGTF factorizes the matrix (T - lambda*I), where T is an n by n
    tridiagonal matrix and lambda is a scalar, as

       T - lambda*I = PLU,

    where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower tridiagonal matrix
    with at most one non-zero sub-diagonal elements per column and U is
    an upper triangular matrix with at most two non-zero super-diagonal
    elements per column.

    The factorization is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial
    pivoting and implicit row scaling.

    The parameter LAMBDA is included in the routine so that SLAGTF may
    be used, in conjunction with SLAGTS, to obtain eigenvectors of T by
    inverse iteration.

          normally be chose as approximately the largest relative error
          in the elements of T. For example, if the elements of T are
          correct to about 4 significant figures, then TOL should be
          set to about 5*10**(-4). If TOL is supplied as less than eps,
          where eps is the relative machine precision, then the value
          eps is used in place of TOL.

          On exit, IN contains details of the permutation matrix P. If
          an interchange occurred at the kth step of the elimination,
          then IN(k) = 1, otherwise IN(k) = 0. The element IN(n)
            returns the smallest positive integer j such that

             abs(u(j,j)) <= norm((T - lambda*I)(j))*TOL,

               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
               it is used to solve a system of equations.

               NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
               a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
               is not stored in INFO even though the factorization

    dealing with the Hessenberg submatrix in rows and columns ILO to
    IHI.

 * @param[in] WANTZ
 
          WANTZ is LOGICAL
          = .TRUE. : the matrix of Schur vectors Z is required;

 * @param[in] ILO
 
          ILO is INTEGER
 

 * @param[in] IHI
 
          IHI is INTEGER
          It is assumed that H is already upper quasi-triangular in
          rows and columns IHI+1:N, and that H(ILO,ILO-1) = 0 (unless
          ILO = 1). SLAHQR works primarily with the Hessenberg
          submatrix in rows and columns ILO to IHI, but applies
          transformations to all of H if WANTT is .TRUE..
          1 <= ILO <= max(1,IHI); IHI <= N.
 

 * @param[in,out] H
 
          H is REAL array, dimension (LDH,N)
          On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
          On exit, if INFO is zero and if WANTT is .TRUE., H is upper
          quasi-triangular in rows and columns ILO:IHI, with any
          2-by-2 diagonal blocks in standard form. If INFO is zero
          and WANTT is .FALSE., the contents of H are unspecified on

          WR is REAL array, dimension (N)

          WI is REAL array, dimension (N)
          The real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the computed
          eigenvalues ILO to IHI are stored in the corresponding
          elements of WR and WI. If two eigenvalues are computed as a
          complex conjugate pair, they are stored in consecutive
          elements of WR and WI, say the i-th and (i+1)th, with
          WI(i) > 0 and WI(i+1) < 0. If WANTT is .TRUE., the
          eigenvalues are stored in the same order as on the diagonal
          of the Schur form   returned in H, with WR(i) = H(i,i), and, if
          H(i:i+1,i:i+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block,
          WI(i) = sqrt(H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1)) and WI(i+1) = -WI(i).

 * @param[in,out] Z
 
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ,N)
          If WANTZ is .TRUE., on entry Z must contain the current
          matrix Z of transformations accumulated by SHSEQR, and on
          exit Z has been updated; transformations are applied only to
          the submatrix Z(ILOZ:IHIZ,ILO:IHI).
          If WANTZ is .FALSE., Z is not referenced.
 

 * @param[in] LDZ
 
          LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z. LDZ >= max(1,N).

                  contain those eigenvalues which have been
                  successfully computed.

                  If INFO > 0 and WANTT is .FALSE., then on exit,
                  the remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the
                  eigenvalues of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows
                  and columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
                  value of H.

/*! @brief LALN2 solves a 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 linear system of equations of the specified form

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LALN2 solves a system of the form  (ca A - w D) X = s B
    or (ca A**T - w D) X = s B   with possible scaling ("s") and
    perturbation of A.  (A**T means A-transpose.)

    A is an NA x NA real matrix, ca is a real scalar, D is an NA x NA
    real diagonal matrix, w is a real or complex value, and X and B are
    NA x 1 matrices -- real if w is real, complex if w is complex.  NA
    may be 1 or 2.

    If w is complex, X and B are represented as NA x 2 matrices,
    the first column of each being the real part and the second
    being the imaginary part.

    "s" is a scaling factor (<= 1), computed by SLALN2, which is
    so chosen that X can be computed without overflow.  X is further
    scaled if necessary to assure that norm(ca A - w D)*norm(X) is less
    than overflow.

    If both singular values of (ca A - w D) are less than SMIN,
    SMIN*identity will be used instead of (ca A - w D).  If only one
    singular value is less than SMIN, one element of (ca A - w D) will be
    perturbed enough to make the smallest singular value roughly SMIN.
    If both singular values are at least SMIN, (ca A - w D) will not be
    perturbed.  In any case, the perturbation will be at most some small
    multiple of max(SMIN, ulp*norm(ca A - w D)).  The singular values
    are computed by infinity-norm approximations, and thus will only be
    correct to a factor of 2 or so.

    Note: all input quantities are assumed to be smaller than overflow
    by a reasonable factor.  (See BIGNUM.)

    to the right hand side matrix B in solving the least squares problem
    using the divide-and-conquer SVD approach.

    For the left singular vector matrix, three types of orthogonal
    matrices are involved:

    (1L) Givens rotations: the number of such rotations is GIVPTR; the
         pairs of columns/rows they were applied to are stored in GIVCOL;
         and the C- and S-values of these rotations are stored in GIVNUM.

    (2L) Permutation. The (NL+1)-st row of B is to be moved to the first
         row, and for J=2:N, PERM(J)-th row of B is to be moved to the
         J-th row.

    (3L) The left singular vector matrix of the remaining matrix.

    For the right singular vector matrix, four types of orthogonal
    matrices are involved:

    (1R) The right singular vector matrix of the remaining matrix.

    (2R) If SQRE = 1, one extra Givens rotation to generate the right

/*! @brief LANEG computes the Sturm count

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LANEG computes the Sturm count, the number of negative pivots
    encountered while factoring tridiagonal T - sigma I = L D L^T.
    This implementation works directly on the factors without forming
    the tridiagonal matrix T.  The Sturm count is also the number of
    eigenvalues of T less than sigma.

    This routine is called from SLARRB.

    The current routine does not use the PIVMIN parameter but rather
    requires IEEE-754 propagation of Infinities and NaNs.  This
    routine also has no input range restrictions but does require
    default exception handling such that x/0 produces Inf when x is
    non-zero, and Inf/Inf produces NaN.  For more information, see:

           and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N and, if ILO > 1,
           H(ILO,ILO-1) is zero. ILO and IHI are normally set by a

           eigenvalues of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI) are stored in WR(ILO:IHI)
           and WI(ILO:IHI). If two eigenvalues are computed as a
           complex conjugate pair, they are stored in consecutive
           elements of WR and WI, say the i-th and (i+1)th, with
           WI(i) > 0 and WI(i+1) < 0. If WANTT is .TRUE., then

          LWORK is INTEGER
           The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N)
           is sufficient, but LWORK typically as large as 6*N may
           be required for optimal performance.  A workspace query
           to determine the optimal workspace size is recommended.

           If LWORK = -1, then SLAQR0 does a workspace query.
           In this case, SLAQR0 checks the input parameters and
           estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
           values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is   returned
           in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is
           issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.

                the eigenvalues.  Elements 1:ilo-1 and i+1:n of WR
                and WI contain those eigenvalues which have been
                successfully computed.  (Failures are rare.)

                If INFO > 0 and WANT is .FALSE., then on exit,
                the remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the eigen-
                values of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows and
                columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
                value of H.

                where U is an orthogonal matrix.  The final
                value of H is upper Hessenberg and quasi-triangular
                in rows and columns INFO+1 through IHI.

/*! @brief LAQR4 computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix, and optionally the matrices from the Schur decomposition 

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LAQR4 implements one level of recursion for SLAQR0.
    It is a complete implementation of the small bulge multi-shift
    QR algorithm.  It may be called by SLAQR0 and, for large enough
    deflation window size, it may be called by SLAQR3.  This
    subroutine is identical to SLAQR0 except that it calls SLAQR2
    instead of SLAQR3.

    SLAQR4 computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H
    and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition
    H = Z T Z**T, where T is an upper quasi-triangular matrix (the
    Schur form), and Z is the orthogonal matrix of Schur vectors.

    Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input orthogonal
    matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization
    of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H
    by the orthogonal matrix Q:  A = Q*H*Q**T = (QZ)*T*(QZ)**T.
    \endverbatim

 * @param[in] WANTZ
 
          WANTZ is LOGICAL
          = .TRUE. : the matrix of Schur vectors Z is required;
          = .FALSE.: Schur vectors are not required.
 

 * @param[in] N
 
          N is INTEGER
           The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.
 

 * @param[in] ILO
 
          ILO is INTEGER
 

 * @param[in] IHI
 
          IHI is INTEGER
           It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows
           and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N and, if ILO > 1,
           H(ILO,ILO-1) is zero. ILO and IHI are normally set by a
           previous call to SGEBAL, and then passed to SGEHRD when the
           matrix output by SGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg form.
           Otherwise, ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N,
           respectively.  If N > 0, then 1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N.
           If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.
 

 * @param[in,out] H
 
          H is REAL array, dimension (LDH,N)
           On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
           On exit, if INFO = 0 and WANTT is .TRUE., then H contains
           the upper quasi-triangular matrix T from the Schur
           decomposition (the Schur form); 2-by-2 diagonal blocks
           (corresponding to complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues)
           are   returned in standard form, with H(i,i) = H(i+1,i+1)
           and H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1) < 0. If INFO = 0 and WANTT is
           .FALSE., then the contents of H are unspecified on exit.
           (The output value of H when INFO > 0 is given under the
           description of INFO below.)

           This subroutine may explicitly set H(i,j) = 0 for i > j and

          WR is REAL array, dimension (IHI)
 

 * @param[out] WI
 
          WI is REAL array, dimension (IHI)
           The real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the computed
           eigenvalues of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI) are stored in WR(ILO:IHI)
           and WI(ILO:IHI). If two eigenvalues are computed as a
           complex conjugate pair, they are stored in consecutive
           elements of WR and WI, say the i-th and (i+1)th, with
           WI(i) > 0 and WI(i+1) < 0. If WANTT is .TRUE., then
           the eigenvalues are stored in the same order as on the
           diagonal of the Schur form   returned in H, with
           WR(i) = H(i,i) and, if H(i:i+1,i:i+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal
           block, WI(i) = sqrt(-H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1)) and

           1 <= ILOZ <= ILO; IHI <= IHIZ <= N.
 

 * @param[in,out] Z
 
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ,IHI)
           If WANTZ is .FALSE., then Z is not referenced.
           If WANTZ is .TRUE., then Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ) is
           replaced by Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ)*U where U is the
           orthogonal Schur factor of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI).
           (The output value of Z when INFO > 0 is given under
           the description of INFO below.)
 

 * @param[in] LDZ
 
          LDZ is INTEGER
           The leading dimension of the array Z.  if WANTZ is .TRUE.
           then LDZ >= MAX(1,IHIZ).  Otherwise, LDZ >= 1.
 

 * @param[out] WORK
 
          WORK is REAL array, dimension LWORK
           On exit, if LWORK = -1, WORK(1)   returns an estimate of
           the optimal value for LWORK.
 

 * @param[in] LWORK
 
          LWORK is INTEGER
           The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N)
           is sufficient, but LWORK typically as large as 6*N may
           be required for optimal performance.  A workspace query
           to determine the optimal workspace size is recommended.

           If LWORK = -1, then SLAQR4 does a workspace query.
           In this case, SLAQR4 checks the input parameters and
           estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
           values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is   returned
           in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is
           issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.
 

 * @param[out] INFO
 
          INFO is INTEGER
 
          INFO is INTEGER
             = 0:  successful exit
             > 0:  if INFO = i, SLAQR4 failed to compute all of
                the eigenvalues.  Elements 1:ilo-1 and i+1:n of WR
                and WI contain those eigenvalues which have been
                successfully computed.  (Failures are rare.)

                If INFO > 0 and WANT is .FALSE., then on exit,
                the remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the eigen-
                values of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows and
                columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
                value of H.

                If INFO > 0 and WANTT is .TRUE., then on exit

           (*)  (initial value of H)*U  = U*(final value of H)

                where U is a orthogonal matrix.  The final
                value of  H is upper Hessenberg and triangular in
                rows and columns INFO+1 through IHI.

                If INFO > 0 and WANTZ is .TRUE., then on exit

    \verbatim 
    LAR1V computes the (scaled) r-th column of the inverse of
    the sumbmatrix in rows B1 through BN of the tridiagonal matrix
    L D L**T - sigma I. When sigma is close to an eigenvalue, the
    computed vector is an accurate eigenvector. Usually, r corresponds
    to the index where the eigenvector is largest in magnitude.
    The following steps accomplish this computation :
    (a) Stationary qd transform, L D L**T - sigma I = L(+) D(+) L(+)**T,
    (b) Progressive qd transform, L D L**T - sigma I = U(-) D(-) U(-)**T,
    (c) Computation of the diagonal elements of the inverse of
        L D L**T - sigma I by combining the above transforms, and choosing
        r as the index where the diagonal of the inverse is (one of the)
        largest in magnitude.
    (d) Computation of the (scaled) r-th column of the inverse using the

    LARRD computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal

    The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
    in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
    eigenvalues.

    To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
    largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
    accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.

                        on the spectrum.

          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
                were not computed:
                =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
                        eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
                        negative block number.  The effect is that the
                        eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
                        absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
                        generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
                        arithmetic.
                =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
                        IL:IU were found.
                        Effect: M < IU+1-IL
                        Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
                                Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
                        Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
                                out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
                                increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
                                make things work.
                = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
                        initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
                        were computed.
                        Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
                                        floating-point arithmetic.
                        Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
                              recompile, and try again.

/*! @brief LARRE given the tridiagonal matrix T, sets small off-diagonal elements to \n

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    To find the desired eigenvalues of a given real symmetric
    tridiagonal matrix T, SLARRE sets any "small" off-diagonal
    elements to zero, and for each unreduced block T_i, it finds
    (a) a suitable shift at one end of the block's spectrum,
    (b) the base representation, T_i - sigma_i I = L_i D_i L_i^T, and
    (c) eigenvalues of each L_i D_i L_i^T.
    The representations and eigenvalues found are then used by
    SSTEMR to compute the eigenvectors of T.
    The accuracy varies depending on whether bisection is used to
    find a few eigenvalues or the dqds algorithm (subroutine SLASQ2) to
    conpute all and then discard any unwanted one.
    As an added benefit, SLARRE also outputs the n
    Gerschgorin intervals for the matrices L_i D_i L_i^T.

/*! @brief LASD1 computes the SVD of an upper bidiagonal matrix B of the specified size. Used by sbdsdc

 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LASD1 computes the SVD of an upper bidiagonal N-by-M matrix B,
    where N = NL + NR + 1 and M = N + SQRE. SLASD1 is called from SLASD0.

    A related subroutine SLASD7 handles the case in which the singular
    values (and the singular vectors in factored form) are desired.

    SLASD1 computes the SVD as follows:

                  (D1(in)    0    0       0)
      B = U(in) * (  Z1**T   a   Z2**T    b) * VT(in)
                  (  0       0   D2(in)   0)

        = U(out) * (D(out) 0) * VT(out)

    where Z**T = (Z1**T a Z2**T b) = u**T VT**T, and u is a vector of dimension M
    with ALPHA and BETA in the NL+1 and NL+2 th entries and zeros
    elsewhere; and the entry b is empty if SQRE = 0.

    The left singular vectors of the original matrix are stored in U, and
    the transpose of the right singular vectors are stored in VT, and the
    singular values are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

       The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
       when there are multiple singular values or when there are zeros in
       the Z vector.  For each such occurrence the dimension of the
       secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
       performed by the routine SLASD2.

       The second stage consists of calculating the updated
       singular values. This is done by finding the square roots of the
       roots of the secular equation via the routine SLASD4 (as called
       by SLASD3). This routine also calculates the singular vectors of
       the current problem.

       The final stage consists of computing the updated singular vectors
       directly using the updated singular values.  The singular vectors
       for the current problem are multiplied with the singular vectors
       from the overall problem.

/*! @brief LASD6 computes the SVD of an updated upper bidiagonal matrix \n

     Used by sbdsdc
 * @details
 * \b Purpose:
    \verbatim 
    LASD6 computes the SVD of an updated upper bidiagonal matrix B
    obtained by merging two smaller ones by appending a row. This
    routine is used only for the problem which requires all singular
    values and optionally singular vector matrices in factored form.
    B is an N-by-M matrix with N = NL + NR + 1 and M = N + SQRE.
    A related subroutine, SLASD1, handles the case in which all singular
    values and singular vectors of the bidiagonal matrix are desired.

    SLASD6 computes the SVD as follows:

                  (D1(in)    0    0       0)
      B = U(in) * (  Z1**T   a   Z2**T    b) * VT(in)
                  (  0       0   D2(in)   0)

        = U(out) * (D(out) 0) * VT(out)

    where Z**T = (Z1**T a Z2**T b) = u**T VT**T, and u is a vector of dimension M
    with ALPHA and BETA in the NL+1 and NL+2 th entries and zeros
    elsewhere; and the entry b is empty if SQRE = 0.

    The singular values of B can be computed using D1, D2, the first
    components of all the right singular vectors of the lower block, and
    the last components of all the right singular vectors of the upper
    block. These components are stored and updated in VF and VL,
    respectively, in SLASD6. Hence U and VT are not explicitly
    referenced.

    The singular values are stored in D. The algorithm consists of two
    stages:

          The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
          when there are multiple singular values or if there is a zero
          in the Z vector. For each such occurrence the dimension of the
          secular equation problem is reduced by one. This stage is
          performed by the routine SLASD7.

          The second stage consists of calculating the updated
          singular values. This is done by finding the roots of the
          secular equation via the routine SLASD4 (as called by SLASD8).
          This routine also updates VF and VL and computes the distances
          between the updated singular values and the old singular
          values.

    SLASD6 is called from SLASDA.

    the Aasen's algorithm. The panel consists of a set of NB rows of A
    when UPLO is U, or a set of NB columns when UPLO is L.
   
    In order to factorize the panel, the Aasen's algorithm requires the
    last row, or column, of the previous panel. The first row, or column,
    of A is set to be the first row, or column, of an identity matrix,
    which is used to factorize the first panel.
   
    The resulting J-th row of U, or J-th column of L, is stored in the
    (J-1)-th row, or column, of A (without the unit diagonals), while
    the diagonal and subdiagonal of A are overwritten by those of T.

 * @param[out] IPIV
 
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          IPIV describes the permutation matrix P in the factorization
          of matrix A as follows. The absolute value of IPIV(k)
          represents the index of row and column that were
          interchanged with the k-th row and column. The value of UPLO
          describes the order in which the interchanges were applied.
          Also, the sign of IPIV represents the block structure of
          the symmetric block diagonal matrix D with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2
          diagonal blocks which correspond to 1 or 2 interchanges
          at each factorization step.

                  k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged

                  If -IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
               2) If -IPIV(k-1) != k-1, rows and columns
                  k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were interchanged

            d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.

          If UPLO = 'L',
          (in factorization order, k increases from 1 to N):
            a) A single positive entry IPIV(k) > 0 means:
               D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
               If IPIV(k) != k, rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
               interchanged in the submatrix A(1:N,1:KB).
               If IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.

            b) A pair of consecutive negative entries
               IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k+1) < 0 means:
               D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                  in the submatrix A(1:N,1:KB).
                  If -IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
               2) If -IPIV(k+1) != k+1, rows and columns
                  k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were interchanged
                  in the submatrix A(1:N,1:KB).
                  If -IPIV(k+1) = k+1, no interchange occurred.

            c) In both cases a) and b) is always ABS(IPIV(k)) >= k.

            d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.
 

 * @param[out] W
 
          W is REAL array, dimension (LDW,NB)
 

 * @param[in] LDW
 
          LDW is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array W.  LDW >= max(1,N).
 

 * @param[out] INFO
 
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit

          < 0: If INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value

          > 0: If INFO = k, the matrix A is singular, because:
                 If UPLO = 'U': column k in the upper
                 triangular part of A contains all zeros.
                 If UPLO = 'L': column k in the lower
                 triangular part of A contains all zeros.

               Therefore D(k,k) is exactly zero, and superdiagonal
               elements of column k of U (or subdiagonal elements of
               column k of L) are all zeros. The factorization has
               been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
               it is used to solve a system of equations.

               NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
               a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
               is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
               always completes.
