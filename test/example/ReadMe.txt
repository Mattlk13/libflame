# LibFLAME Samples
This directory contains sample source files showing usage of LibFLAME library functions. 
Use the provided cmake script file "CMakeLists.txt" to compile and run the programs. Same cmake
script can be used for both Linux and Windows platforms.

## Build steps on Linux and windows

1. Move to installed examples directory
        ```
        cd test/examples
        ```
2. Configure the build system to compile sample applications
        ```
        cmake . -DEXT_BLAS_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCY_PATH=/path/to/blas/library
        -DEXT_LAPACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libflame/library
        -DEXT_BLAS_LIBNAME=blas_lib_name -DEXT_LAPACK_LIBNAME=libflame_lib_name
        -DEXT_FLAME_HEADER_PATH=/path/to/flame/header/file
        ```
        eg:
        ```
        cmake . -DEXT_BLAS_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCY_PATH=../../lib/ -DEXT_LAPACK_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib 
        -DEXT_BLAS_LIBNAME=libblis-mt.a -DEXT_LAPACK_LIBNAME=libflame.a
        --DEXT_FLAME_HEADER_PATH=../../include/
        ```

3. Compile the sample application
        ```
        For Linux
                cmake --build . or make
        For Windows
                cmake --build .
        ```

4. Run the application
        ```
        For Linux
                ./test_dgetrf.x
        For Windows
                cd Debug
                test_dgetrf.exe
        ```
